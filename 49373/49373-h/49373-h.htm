<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>Having been compelled by the results of my
investigations on the question of the Origin of
Life to arrive at conclusions adverse to generally
received opinions, I found that several persons
having high authority in matters of science, were
little disposed to assent to these views. To a
great extent this seemed due to the fact that
a distinguished chemist had previously gone over
some of the same ground, and had arrived at
precisely opposite conclusions. M. Pasteur has been
long known as an able and brilliant experimenter,
and some of his admirers seem to regard him
as an almost equally faultless reasoner.</p>

<p>Renewed and prolonged experimentation having
tended to demonstrate the truth of my original
conclusions, and to convince me of the utter
untenability of M. Pasteur’s views, it seemed
that the best course to pursue would be, at first,
to endeavour to show into what errors of reasoning<span class="pagenum" title="viii"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii"></a></span>
M. Pasteur had fallen, and also how his conclusions
were capable of being reversed by the
employment of different experimental materials,
and different experimental methods. Then, having
presented, in a connected form, evidence which
might suffice to shake the faith of all who
preserved a right of independent judgment, one
might hope to have paved the way for the reception
of new views&mdash;even though they were adverse
to those of M. Pasteur. The present volume contains,
indeed, only a fragment of the evidence
which will be embodied in a much larger work&mdash;now
almost completed&mdash;relating to the nature
and origin of living matter, and in favour of
what is termed the physical doctrine of Life.</p>

<p>The question of the mode of origin of Living
Matter, is inextricably mixed up with another problem
as to the cause of fermentation and putrefaction.
M. Pasteur’s labours were, at first, undertaken in
order to solve the latter difficulty&mdash;to decide,
in fact, between two rival hypotheses. It was
held, on the one hand, that many ferments
were mere dead nitrogenous substances, and that
fermentation was a purely chemical process, for
the initiation of which the action of living organisms
was not necessary; whilst, on the other hand,<span class="pagenum" title="ix"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix"></a></span>
it was also maintained that no fermentation could
be initiated without the agency of living things&mdash;in
fact, that <i>all</i> ferments were living organisms.
The former may be called the <i>physical</i> theory of
fermentation, of which Baron Liebig is the most
prominent modern exponent; whilst the latter may
be termed the <i>vital</i> theory of fermentation, and this
is the doctrine of M. Pasteur. All the facts which
I have to adduce, so far as the subject of fermentation
is concerned, are wholly in favour of the
views of Baron Liebig.</p>

<p>And, the conclusions arrived at in this work are
confirmed by the results of several unpublished
experiments, in which living organisms have been
taken from flasks that had, a few weeks before, been
hermetically sealed and heated for a variable time to
temperatures ranging from 260°&nbsp;F. to 302°&nbsp;F.</p>

<p>With the view of aiding some of my readers
in their interpretation of the results of some of
the experiments contained in this volume, I would
call their attention to the following considerations.
If fluids <i>in vacuo</i> (in hermetically-sealed flasks),
which were clear at first, have gradually become
turbid; and if on microscopical examination this
turbidity is found to be almost wholly due to the
presence of <i>Bacteria</i> or other organisms, then it<span class="pagenum" title="x"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x"></a></span>
would be sheer trifling gravely to discuss whether
the organisms were living or dead, on the strength of
the mere activity or languor of the movements which
they may be seen to display. Can dead organisms
multiply in a closed flask to such an extent as to
make an originally clear fluid become quite turbid
in the course of two or three days?</p>

<p>And if any one wishes to convince himself as to
whether such turbidity can occur in a flask which is
still hermetically sealed, let him take one that has
been prepared in the manner I have elsewhere described,
carefully heat the neck of it in a spirit-lamp
flame, and see how the rapid in-bending of the red-hot
glass testifies to the preservation of a partial
vacuum within. The vacuum in such cases is only
partially preserved, because of the emission of a
certain amount of gases within the flask&mdash;such as
invariably occurs during the progress of fermentation
or putrefaction.</p>

<p>In these experiments with heated fluids in closed
flasks, nothing is easier than to obtain negative
results. The same kinds of infusions which&mdash;if
care has been taken to obtain them strong enough&mdash;will
in a few days teem with living organisms, often
show no trace of living things after much longer
periods, when the solutions are weak. Again, in<span class="pagenum" title="xi"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi"></a></span>
those cases where only a few organisms exist in
a solution which has been made the subject of
experimentation, nothing is easier than by a perfunctory
examination of the fluid to fail in finding
any of these sparsely-distributed living organisms.
Experiments, the results of which are positive,
may, therefore, in the absence of sufficient care,
be cited as negative; and experiments which
would otherwise have been crowned with unmistakeably
positive results, may be rendered wholly
barren by the employment of infusions which have
been carelessly made.</p>

<p>A word of explanation seems necessary with
regard to the introduction of the new term
<i>Archebiosis</i>. I had originally, in unpublished writings,
adopted the word <i>Biogenesis</i> to express
the same meaning&mdash;viz., life-origination or commencement.
But in the mean time the word <i>Biogenesis</i>
has been made use of, quite independently,
by a distinguished biologist, who wished to make
it bear a totally different meaning. He also introduced
the word <i>Abiogenesis</i>. I have been informed,
however, on the best authority, that neither of these
words can&mdash;with any regard to the language from
which they are derived&mdash;be supposed to bear the
meanings which have of late been publicly assigned<span class="pagenum" title="xii"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii"></a></span>
to them. Wishing to avoid all needless confusion,
I therefore renounced the use of the word <i>Biogenesis</i>,
and being, for the reason just given, unable
to adopt the other term, I was compelled to introduce
a new word, in order to designate the process
by which living matter is supposed to come into
being, independently of pre-existing living matter.</p>

<h2><span class="fs90">THE MODES OF ORIGIN</span><br />
<span class="fs60">OF</span><br />
<span class="fs140">LOWEST ORGANISMS.</span></h2>


<p>The mode of origin of <i>Bacteria</i>, and, to a less extent,
of <i>Torulæ</i>, has been much discussed of late, and many
different views have been advocated on this subject by
successive writers.</p>

<p>It is of much importance to bear in mind when such
views are under consideration, that a short time since
nothing was positively known concerning the life-history
of these organisms. However strongly, therefore,
certain persons are inclined to rely upon the
analogy which is supposed to obtain between these
doubtful cases, and the multitudes of known cases&mdash;in
which it can be shown that organisms are the
offspring of pre-existing organisms&mdash;it must always
be borne in mind that in many of the doubtful cases,
where the simplest organisms are concerned, there is
also an analogical argument of almost equal weight
adducible in favour of their <i>de novo</i> origination&mdash;after
a fashion, and under the influence of laws<span class="pagenum" title="2"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a></span>
similar to those by which crystals arise. To rely
too exclusively upon an argument from analogy is
always perilous: it is more than usually so, however,
in a case like this, where what is practically
an opposing analogy may be deemed to speak just
as authoritatively in an opposite direction.</p>

<p>There is one consideration, moreover, which deserves
to be pointed out here, and which does not seem to
have occurred to most of those who so firmly pin their
faith to the truth of the motto “<i>omne vivum ex vivo</i>.”
The every-day experience of mankind, supplemented
by the ordinary observations of skilled naturalists, does
pretty fairly entitle us to arrive at a wide generalization,
to the effect that <i>some representatives of every
kind of organism are capable of reproducing similar
organisms</i>. But, whilst this is all that the actual
every-day experience of mankind warrants being said,
and whilst there is in reality the widest possible gulf
between such a generalization and that which is expressed
by the motto “<i>omne vivum ex vivo</i>,” the
latter formula has of late been spoken of as though
it were the one which was in accordance with the daily
experience of mankind, rather than the other, which
gives expression to a generalization of a much narrower
description. This experience, in reality, affords
no evidence which could entitle us to place implicit
belief in the formula “<i>omne vivum ex vivo</i>.”</p>

<p>Whilst we do know something about the ability
which most organisms possess of reproducing similar<span class="pagenum" title="3"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a></span>
organisms, we cannot possibly say, from direct observation,
that every organism which exists has had
a similar mode of origin, because the cases in which
organisms may have originated <i>de novo</i> are the very
cases in which their mode of origin must elude our
actual observation. Such a statement, too, would be
all the more dangerous, in the face of the other
analogy, when it can actually be shown that some
organisms do make their appearance in fluids after
precisely the same fashion as crystals.</p>

<p>Although, therefore, there is a contradiction between
the unwarrantable and ill-begotten formula, “<i>omne
vivum ex vivo</i>,” and the doctrines of what has been
called “Spontaneous Generation”; there is no contradiction
whatever between such doctrines and the
only generalization which we are really warranted
in arriving at, to the effect that <i>some representatives
of every kind of organism are capable of reproducing
similar organisms</i>.</p>

<p><i>Bacteria</i>, <i>Torulæ</i>, or other living things which may
have been evolved <i>de novo</i>, when so evolved, multiply
and reproduce just as freely as organisms that have
been derived from parents.</p>

<p>The views as to the origin of <i>Bacteria</i> and <i>Torulæ</i>
which are most worthy of attention, may be thus
enumerated:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>a.</i> That they are independent organisms derived by
fission or gemmation from pre-existing <i>Bacteria</i> and
<i>Torulæ</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="4"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a></span></p>

<p><i>b.</i> That they represent subordinate stages in the
life-history of other organisms (fungi), from some
portion of which they have derived their origin, and
into which they again tend to develop.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> That they may have a heterogeneous mode of
origin, owing to the more complete individualization
of minute particles of living matter entering into the
composition of higher organisms, both animal and
vegetal.</p>

<p><i>d.</i> That they may arise <i>de novo</i> in certain fluids
containing organic matter, independently of pre-existing
living things (<i>Archebiosis</i>).</p>

<p>I shall make some remarks concerning each of these
views, though the evidence I have to adduce mainly
concerns the possibility of the origin of <i>Bacteria</i> and
<i>Torulæ</i> in the way last alluded to, viz., by <i>Archebiosis</i>.</p>

<p>The third mode of origin is what is called <i>Heterogenesis</i>;
whilst the first and second modes are
the representatives of more familiar processes, included
under the head of <i>Homogenesis</i>. Thus, in
accordance with the first view, <i>Bacteria</i> may be
regarded as low organisms having a distinct individuality
of their own and multiplying by a process
of fission&mdash;thus affording instances of what I propose
to term <i>direct Homogenesis</i>. Whilst, in accordance
with the second view, <i>Bacteria</i> are supposed to represent
merely one stage in the life-history of higher
organisms, which are therefore reproduced by an <i>indirect</i>
or cyclical process of <i>Homogenesis</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="5"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a></span></p>

<p>The possible modes of origin of <i>Bacteria</i> and
<i>Torulæ</i> may, therefore, be tabulated as follows:&mdash;</p>

<h3>I. <span class="smcap">Homogenetic Mode of Origin of Bacteria
and Torulæ.</span></h3>

<p><i>Bacteria</i> and <i>Torulæ</i> being already in existence,
they may, undoubtedly, reproduce organisms similar
to themselves by processes of fission and gemmation&mdash;in
the same way that other low protistic
organisms propagate their kind. Although so many
reasons rendered this view probable, it was some
time before I was able actually to confirm it by
personal observations in the case of <i>Bacteria</i>. In the
ordinary microscopical examination of portions of an
infusion containing these organisms, an observer may
watch for hours and never see a single instance of
such fission occurring. His attention is apt to be distracted
by the number of organisms which are constantly
flitting before his view, and he is, moreover,
perhaps apt to pay particular attention to those which
seem by their movements to be most obviously alive.</p>

<p>I have observed the process most plainly when a
few <i>Bacteria</i> have been enclosed in a single drop of
fluid, pressed into a very thin stratum, in a “live-box”
kept at a temperature of about 90° Fahr. by resting<span class="pagenum" title="6"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a></span>
on one of Stricker’s warm-water chambers placed on
the stage of the microscope. Under these conditions,
I have seen a <i>Bacterium</i> of moderate size divide into
two, and each of these into two others somewhat
smaller, in the course of fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>It is still more worthy of remark, that in all cases
(so far as I have been able to observe), this, the most
certain sign of vitality which such organisms are
capable of manifesting, is shown by those which,
from their stillness, might be considered dead. The
<i>Bacteria</i> which are about to divide are generally either
motionless<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></span> or merely present slight oscillating movements.
The separation is quickly brought about at
the joint, so that the original organism divides into
two equal portions; and these, lying close together,
soon develop a new construction as they grow, through
which a further division may occur.</p>

<p>That the <i>Bacteria</i> which reproduce should be in a
comparatively quiescent condition, seems not difficult
to understand. Such rudimentary organisms do not appear
to possess cilia or other locomotory appendages:
their movements are, therefore, in all probability dependent
upon the mere molecular changes which are
taking place within them, and upon which their life
and nutrition depend. The process of fission must,
however, be considered as the result of a new effort at<span class="pagenum" title="7"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a></span>
equilibrium, which has, perhaps, been necessitated
by molecular changes that have occurred during a
preceding period of growth. The living matter which
is no longer able to exist round a single centre,
re-arranges itself around two centres,&mdash;as a result of
which, fission occurs. It seems only natural, therefore,
that whilst this active work of molecular re-arrangement
is going on, those other molecular
movements which occasion the actual locomotion
of the organism from place to place, should be more
or less interfered with.</p>

<p>This is the one and only mode of multiplication of
<i>Bacteria</i> and of <i>Torulæ</i> which is actually known to
occur; and such a limitation is in accordance with the
more general fact, that processes of fission or gemmation
are the only means of reproduction that are known
to occur in the lower kinds of organisms, belonging to
the <span class="lowercase smcap">PROTISTIC</span> kingdom.</p>

<p>However well this process of fission may have
been established, as a frequent mode of reproduction
of <i>Bacteria</i>, such a fact does not lend any support to
the notion that these are necessarily distinct and
independent organisms. <i>Torulæ</i> (of which beer-yeast
is the most familiar example) may similarly undergo
this process of mere vegetative repetition to an
indefinite extent, whilst only some of the products
develop into fungi. The gonidia of lichens may also
reproduce indefinitely in this fashion, and only some
of the products of multiplication may go on to the<span class="pagenum" title="8"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a></span>
production of lichens similar to that from which the
gonidia had been derived.</p>

<p>It is a fact, however, admitted by many, and
which any patient microscopist is capable of verifying
for himself, that some <i>Bacteria</i> do develop into
<i>Leptothrix</i> filaments, and that these are capable of
passing into a dissepimented mycelial structure of
larger size and undoubtedly fungus nature&mdash;from
which fructification of various kinds may be produced.
Some <i>Bacteria</i> may therefore develop into some
fungi, just as certainly as some <i>Torulæ</i> may develop
into other fungi, or, just as surely as some multiplying
gonidia may develop into lichens.</p>

<p>In order to prove, however, that the <i>Bacteria</i> which
happen to go through this development into <i>Leptothrix</i>
and thence into fungi, are strictly to be
considered as <i>necessary</i> links in the life-history of
fungi, it would be essential for the person holding
such views, to show that <i>Bacteria</i> could not arise
independently&mdash;or at least that no independently
evolved <i>Bacteria</i> could develop through <i>Leptothrix</i>-forms
into a fungus. And, similarly, for the other
kinds of organisms: in order to establish that the
<i>Torula</i> cell is a necessary link in the life-history of
certain fungi, or the gonidial cell a necessary link in
the life-history of lichens, it would be necessary to
show that <i>Torulæ</i> or gonidial cells could not originate
<i>de novo</i>&mdash;that no independently evolved <i>Torula</i> or gonidial
cell could develop into a fungus or a lichen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="9"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a></span></p>

<p>An easier position to establish would be, that the
<i>Bacterium</i> or the <i>Torula</i> were <i>occasionally</i> links in the
life-history of fungi, or that the gonidial cell was an
occasional link in the life-history of a lichen. This
doctrine would leave the other more difficult problems,&mdash;as
to the possible existence of supplementary
modes of origin for such organisms by Heterogenesis
or by Archebiosis&mdash;perfectly open questions.</p>

<p>To establish the position that <i>Bacteria</i> are occasional
links in the life-history of fungi, it would be
only necessary to show that some of the <i>Bacteria</i>
which develop into fungi through <i>Leptothrix</i> have
derived their origin from pre-existing fungi. This is
the view which <span class="nowrap">Hallier<a id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></span> has endeavoured to establish;
it is also the doctrine of M. Polotebnow<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></span> and one,
moreover, to which Professor <span class="nowrap">Huxley<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></span> inclines. Even
this mode of origin for <i>Bacteria</i>, however, has not been
so decisively established as might be desired. With
regard to <i>Torulæ</i>, we do possess sufficient evidence
tending to show that some of them may arise from
pre-existing fungi, and we are equally certain that
some gonidial cells are thrown off from lichens. The
analogical evidence is, therefore, in favour of the view
that minute particles which are budded off from the
mycelium of certain fungi, may subsequently lead an<span class="pagenum" title="10"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a></span>
independent existence, and multiply in the form of
<i>Bacteria</i>&mdash;although many of the cases in which such
buds <i>seem</i> to be given off, may be merely cases in
which co-existing <i>Bacteria</i> have become adherent to
fungus filaments or to <i>Torulæ</i><span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></span></p>

<p>But, with reference to these supposed cases of budding,
and also to those others in which the contents of
a spore or sporangium break up into what Professor
Hallier calls “micrococci” (which are generally incipient
<i>Bacteria</i>), it would be difficult for us to decide
whether such processes are normal or abnormal.
When we have to do with such organisms, in fact,
there may be the nicest transitions between what is
called Homogenesis, and what, when occurring in
other organisms, we term Heterogenesis. It may be
that the production of such “micrococci” from the
spore or sporangium of the fungus is not an invariable
incident in the life-history of the species, but rather an
occasional result of the influence of unusual conditions,
or of failing vigour on the part of the organism. In
this latter case we should have to do with a process of<span class="pagenum" title="11"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a></span>
Heterogenesis; although, as I have just stated, in
respect to such low and changeable organisms,
scarcely any distinct line of demarcation can be drawn
between Homogenesis and Heterogenesis.</p>

<p>The evidence seems, therefore, against the notion
that <i>Bacteria</i> or <i>Torulæ</i> are ordinary, independent
living things, which merely reproduce their like.</p>

<p>That some <i>Bacteria</i> are produced from pre-existing
<i>Bacteria</i>, just as some <i>Torulæ</i> are derived from pre-existing
<i>Torulæ</i>, may, it is true, be considered as
settled. But, so far as we have yet considered the
subject, there may be just as good evidence to show
that <i>Bacteria</i> and <i>Torulæ</i> are capable of arising <i>de
novo</i>, as there is that some of them are capable of
developing into fungi.</p>

<p>If this were the case, such types could only be
regarded as the most common forms assumed by
new-born specks of living matter; and, by reason of
their origin&mdash;which would entail an absence of all
hereditary predisposition&mdash;they might be supposed to
be capable of assuming higher developmental forms.</p>

<p>Now, as a matter of fact, worthy of arresting our
attention, we do find that some <i>Bacteria</i> are capable of
growing into <i>Leptothrix</i>, whilst this is able to develop
continuously into a fungus; just as we also know
that some <i>Torulæ</i> are capable of growing into other
fungi.</p>

<p>Should it be established, therefore, that <i>Bacteria</i>
and <i>Torulæ</i> are capable of arising <i>de novo</i>, the facts<span class="pagenum" title="12"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a></span>
concerning their mutability are harmonious enough
with theoretical indications.</p>

<p>But, as I have before indicated, although it is quite
true that some <i>Bacteria</i> develop into fungi, such forms
may constitute no necessary links in the life-history of
other fungi. I have suggested that in those (occasional)
cases in which they do occur as links in the life-history
of fungi, there is room for doubt whether these
<i>Bacteria</i> are to be considered as normal products, or
as abnormal results (heterogeneous offcasts), brought
about by some unusual conditions acting upon the
parent fungus. That is to say, we may be doubtful
whether in such a case their origin ought to be considered
Homogenetic or Heterogenetic. It may be
that many of the lower fungi are such changeable
organisms, and so prone to respond to the various
“conditions” acting upon them (which would be almost
certainly the case if they had been developed from a
<i>Bacterium</i> in two or three days&mdash;the <i>Bacterium</i> itself
having been evolved <i>de novo</i>) that no very valid distinction
can here be drawn between Homogenesis and
Heterogenesis. Our whole point of view, in fact, concerning
such fungi as are seen to develop through
<i>Leptothrix</i> forms from <i>Bacteria</i> must be entirely
altered, if it is once conceded that <i>Bacteria</i> may arise
<i>de novo</i>. Such simple <i>Mucedineæ</i> would then have to
be regarded as mere upstart organisms only a few
removes from dead matter, and&mdash;in view of the greater
molecular mobility of living matter&mdash;capable of being<span class="pagenum" title="13"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a></span>
modified in shape and form even more than the most
changeable crystals under the influence of altering
“conditions.” We should have no longer to do with
the members of a stable species, which had been reproducing
its like through countless geologic ages anterior
to the advent of man upon the earth. Indeed, in
order to reconcile such a possibility with the seemingly
contradictory fact of the known extreme changeability
of these lower forms of life, we hear only vague
hints thrown out about our imperfect knowledge of
the “limits within which species may vary.” As if, in
the face of what we do know concerning hereditary
transmission, this changeability did not make it
almost impossible to conceive that there should have
been an unbroken series of such organisms since that
remote epoch of the earth’s history, when the first
organisms of the kind made their appearance. It does
not seem to me that the presumed permanence of a
very changeable organism is consistent with, or rendered
more explicable by, the supposition that <i>some</i>
representatives of the species <i>have</i> constantly been
undergoing progressive modifications which have been
successively perpetuated by inheritance, in the shape
of distinct specific forms. Why should some be presumed
to have undergone so much change, whilst
others (presenting an equal and an extreme degree of
modifiability, even to the present day) are supposed
to have preserved the same specific form through a
countless series of changing influences?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="14"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a></span></p>


<h3>2. <span class="smcap">Heterogenetic Mode of Origin of Bacteria
and of Torulæ.</span></h3>

<p>It has been long known that <i>Bacteria</i> and <i>Torulæ</i>
are frequently to be found within vegetable cells,
taken even from the central parts of plants, whenever
these are in a sickly condition or are actually dying.
They are apt to exist also within epithelial cells taken
from the inside of the mouth; and the frequency and
abundance with which such organisms are met with in
these cells, is almost in direct proportion to the malnutrition
and lack of vital power in the individual who
is the subject of observation. Then, again, in persons
who have died of adynamic diseases, in the course of
twenty-four or thirty-six hours (during warm weather)
<i>Bacteria</i> may be found in abundance within the blood-vessels
of the brain and of other parts, although no
such <i>Bacteria</i> were recognizable in the blood of the
individual during life.</p>

<p>In these cases we must, in order to account for the
presence of the <i>Bacteria</i> and <i>Torulæ</i>, either suppose
that such organisms, in an embryonic state, are almost
universally disseminated throughout the various textures
of higher organisms, both animal and vegetal
(though they are only able to develop and manifest
themselves when the higher organisms, or the parts of
them in which the <i>Bacteria</i> or <i>Torulæ</i> are met with,
are on the eve of death), or else we must imagine
that when the vital activity of any organism, whether<span class="pagenum" title="15"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a></span>
simple or complex, is on the wane, its constituent
particles (being still portions of living matter) are
capable of individualizing themselves, and of growing
into the low organisms in question. Just as the life
of one of the cells of a higher organism may continue
for some time after the death of the organism itself,
so, in accordance with this latter view, may one of the
particles of such a cell be supposed to continue to
live after even cell-life is impossible.</p>

<p>Now, to many persons, the latter seems to be a
much simpler hypothesis than the former, and one,
moreover, which is more in accordance with known
facts. People’s views, however, on this subject are
likely to be much influenced by their notions as to
the possibility of <i>Bacteria</i> arising by a process of
Archebiosis. Although some may be inclined to accept
the doctrine of Heterogenesis, the same persons,
being “vitalists,” may not readily believe in the
doctrine of Archebiosis, because this implies the
vivification of dead matter&mdash;the conversion of not-living
elements into a living combination. Those,
however, who do believe in Archebiosis will&mdash;if the
necessary evidence be forthcoming&mdash;all the more
readily yield their assent to the doctrine of Heterogenesis,
because it is a much less novel thing
to have to believe in the mere transformation of
living matter, than in the possibility of its origin <i>de
novo</i>.</p>

<p>Evidence of a tolerably satisfactory nature, how<span class="pagenum" title="16"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a></span>ever,
is forthcoming, which may speak independently
in favour of the doctrine of <i>Heterogenesis</i>.</p>

<p>It has been affirmed by Crivelli and <span class="nowrap">Maggi<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></span> that
they have actually seen the particles within granular
epithelial cells (taken from the back of the tongue of
a patient suffering from diabetes) grow and elongate,
so as to give rise to <i>Bacteria</i>, or fuse in longitudinal
series, so as to form a <i>Vibrio</i><span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></span> And, moreover, as
I have myself ascertained, if one takes healthy-looking
epithelial scales scraped from the inside of
the mouth, which appear to contain nothing but the
finest granules, and places them with a little saliva
in a “live-box” (and this within a damp chamber kept
at a temperature of about 90° Fahr.), in the course
of from 5 to 10 hours, the cells may be found to be
studded throughout with motionless <i>Bacteria</i>. Of
course it may be said that the granules originally
seen in the cells were offcasts from pre-existing
<span class="nowrap"><i>Bacteria</i><a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></span> which had gained access to the cell.<span class="pagenum" title="17"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a></span>
And although, to many, this may seem an extremely
improbable supposition, it is, nevertheless, one which
it would be very difficult to disprove. The improbability
of the notion is increased, moreover,
when we find that <i>Bacteria</i>, and even <i>Torulæ</i>, will
develop just as freely within closed cells taken from
the very centre of a vegetable tuber, as they will in
the midst of the more solid epithelial cell from the
inside of the mouth. If it be urged that in this latter
situation, there is the greatest chance of the cells
being brought into contact with <i>Bacteria</i>, and that
it must be considered possible for imaginary minute
offcasts from these <i>Bacteria</i> to make their own way
into the substance of the epithelial cell, I am quite
willing to grant the desirability of taking such possibilities
into consideration. But, at the same time,
it seems all the less likely that the actual occurrence
of the <i>Bacteria</i> is explicable on these grounds, because
we find them developing just as freely within
the cells freshly cut from the centre of a tuberous
root, or we may find them already developed within
these cells, if the root has begun to decay. To suppose
that actual germs of <i>Bacteria</i> and of <i>Torulæ</i> are
uniformly distributed throughout the tissues of higher
organisms, is to harbour a hypothesis which would
appear to many to be devoid of all probability&mdash;more
especially when the heterogenetic mode of origin of
larger and higher organisms is a matter of absolute
certainty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="18"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a></span></p>
<h3>3. <span class="smcap">Origin of Bacteria and of Torulæ by
Archebiosis.</span></h3>

<p>The evidence on this part of the subject is, I think,
sharply defined and conclusive. Simple experiments
can be had recourse to, which are not admissible in
the discussion of the question as to the origin of <i>Bacteria</i>
and <i>Torulæ</i> by Heterogenesis. There, we wish to
establish the fact that living matter is capable of undergoing
a certain metamorphosis, and consequently,
we must deal with living matter. Here, however, with
the view of establishing the fact that living matter
can arise <i>de novo</i>, if we are able, shortly after beginning
our experiment, to arrive at a reasonable and well-based
assurance that no living thing exists in the hermetically
sealed experimental vessel&mdash;if the measures
that we have adopted fully entitle us to believe that
all living things which may have pre-existed therein
have been killed&mdash;we may feel pretty sure that any
living organisms which are subsequently found, when
the vessel is broken, must have originated from some
re-arrangements which had taken place amongst the
not-living constituents of the experimental solutions,
whereby life-initiating combinations had been formed.</p>

<p>The possibility of the <i>de novo</i> origination of <i>Bacteria</i>,
<i>Torulæ</i>, and other such organisms, is one which is intimately
associated with the doctrine as to the cause of
fermentation and putrefaction. With regard to the
almost invariable association of such organisms with<span class="pagenum" title="19"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a></span>
some of these processes, almost all are agreed. There
is, moreover, a very frequent association of particular
kinds of organisms with particular kinds of fermentation.
Hence the assumption is an easy and a natural
one to many persons, that the organisms which are
invariably met with in some cases are the causes of
these fermentations<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></span> although it is quite obvious that
the facts on which this view is based, are equally explicable
on the supposition that the organisms are
concomitant results or products (due to new chemical
combinations) of the fermentative changes. In the one
case the fermentative changes are believed to be initiated
by the influence of living organisms; and those
who regard living things as the only true <i>ferments</i>,
for the most part also believe that living things are
incapable of arising <i>de novo</i>. They think that those
organisms which serve to initiate the changes in question,
have been derived from a multitudinous army
of omnipresent atmospheric germs, which are always
ready, in number and kind suitable for every emergency.
This is the doctrine of M. Pasteur and others.
On the other hand, fermentations and putrefactions
may be regarded as sets of chemical changes, which
are apt to occur in organic and other complex substances&mdash;these
changes being due either to the intrinsic<span class="pagenum" title="20"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a></span>
instability of the body which manifests them, or to
molecular movements communicated to it by a still
more unstable body. Baron Liebig says:&mdash;“Many
organic compounds are known, which undergo, in presence
of water, alteration and metamorphosis, having a
certain duration, and ultimately terminating in putrefaction;
while other organic substances that are not
liable to such alteration by themselves, nevertheless,
suffer a similar displacement or separation of their molecules,
when brought into contact with the ferments.”</p>

<p>Each substance belonging to the first class, would
be at the same time, therefore, both ferment and fermentable
substance; whilst a small portion of such
substance, when brought into contact with a less unstable
substance, might induce such molecular movements
as to make it undergo a process of fermentation.
With regard to the cause of such induced fermentative
changes, <span class="nowrap">Gerhardt<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></span> says, in explaining Liebig’s views:&mdash;“Every
substance which decomposes or enters into
combination is in a state of movement, its molecules
being agitated; but since friction, shock, mechanical
agitation, suffice to provoke the decomposition of many
substances (chlorous acid, chloride of nitrogen, fulminating
silver), there is all the more reason why a
chemical decomposition in which the molecular agitation
is more complete, should produce similar effects
upon certain substances. In addition, bodies are
<span class="pagenum" title="21"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a></span>known which when alone are not decomposed by certain
agents, but which are attacked, when they exist
in contact with other bodies incapable of resisting
the influence of these agents. Thus platinum alone
does not dissolve in nitric acid, but when allied with
silver, it is easily dissolved; pure copper is not dissolved
by sulphuric acid, but it does dissolve in this
when it is allied with zinc, &amp;c. According to M.&nbsp;Liebig
it is the same with ferments and fermentable
substances; sugar, which does not change when it is
quite alone, changes&mdash;that is to say ferments&mdash;when
it is in contact with a nitrogenous substance undergoing
change, that is, with a ferment.”</p>

<p>Thus, in accordance with this latter view, living
ferments are not needed&mdash;mere dead, organic or nitrogenous
matter suffices to initiate the processes in
question<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></span> Those who hold this opinion may or may
not believe that organisms are capable of arising
<i>de novo</i><span class="nowrap">;<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></span> though there can be little doubt that a<span class="pagenum" title="22"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a></span>
belief in the truth of such a doctrine does, almost inevitably,
entail a belief in the <i>de novo</i> origination of living
things. No one who has looked into the evidence,
doubts the fact of the association between some of
these processes and the presence of organisms; the only
question is, as to the relation in which they stand to
one another. If organisms are not the causes of those
fermentative changes with which they are invariably
associated, then they are, in all probability, the results
of such changes; and they must certainly have been
produced <i>de novo</i> if it can be shown that fermentation
or putrefaction may take place under the influence of
conditions which make it certain that pre-existing
living organisms could have had nothing to do with
the process.</p>

<p>Now, in order to lend some air of probability to
the former hypothesis, concerning the necessity for the
existence of living ferments, it was incumbent upon its
supporters to endeavour to show that the air did contain
such a multitude of “germs,” or living things, as
were demanded by the requirements of their theory.
Spallanzani and Bonnet had, as far as the imagination
was concerned, done all that was necessary. They
had proclaimed the universal diffusion of “germs” of
all kinds of organisms throughout the atmosphere&mdash;which
were ready to develop, whenever suitable
conditions presented themselves. So far, however,
this was but another hypothesis. To establish the
doctrine that fermentation cannot take place without<span class="pagenum" title="23"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a></span>
the agency of living ferments, we cannot receive hypotheses
in evidence: facts are needed. These, no one
attempted to supply in an adequate <span class="nowrap">manner<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></span> anterior
to the investigations of M. Pasteur. Speaking
of his researches, even M. Milne-Edwards says<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></span> “Previous
to this time, the existence of reproductive particles,
or infusorial germs in the atmosphere was
nothing more than a <i>plausible hypothesis</i>, put forward
in order to explain the origin of such creatures in a
manner conformable with the general laws of reproduction;
but it was only a mere supposition, and no
one had been able actually to see or to handle these
reproductive corpuscles.”</p>

<p>We have to look, therefore, to M. Pasteur’s investigations,
and to others which may have been since
conducted, for all the scientific evidence in support of
what has been called the “Panspermic hypothesis.”</p>

<p>By an ingenious method of filtration, which is fully
described in his memoir<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></span> M. Pasteur separated from
the air that passed through his apparatus the solid
particles which it contained. This search convinced
him that there were, as he says, <span class="pagenum" title="24"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a></span>“constantly in ordinary
air a variable number of corpuscles whose form
and structure declare them to be organized.” Some
of these, he thinks, resemble the spores of fungi, and
others the ova of ciliated infusoria, though he adds:&mdash;“But
as to affirming that this is a spore, much less the
spore of any definite species, and that one is an
egg, and belonging to such an infusorium, I believe
that this is not possible.” He limits himself, in fact,
to the statements, that the corpuscles which he found,
were (in his opinion) evidently organized; that they
resembled in form and appearance the germs of the
lower kinds of organisms; and that, from their
variety in size, they probably belonged to many
different sorts of living things. Even here, therefore,
we have to do with the impressions of M. Pasteur,
rather than with verified statements. All that has
been established by his direct investigation as to the
nature of the solid bodies contained in the atmosphere
is this: that the air contains a number of round or
ovoidal corpuscles, often quite structureless, which
he could not distinguish from the spores of <span class="nowrap">fungi<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></span>&mdash;some
of which, being about the right size, were round
or ovoidal, and structureless. In addition, however,
it has been shown that the air contains other rounded
corpuscles which are similarly structureless, though
composed of silica or starch. It may therefore be
asked, in the first place, whether the conclusion is<span class="pagenum" title="25"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a></span>
a sufficiently safe one that many of the corpuscles
found by M. Pasteur were spores of fungi; and in the
next place, supposing this to have been established,
whether such spores were living or dead. These
questions would have been answered satisfactorily if
M. Pasteur could state that he had actually watched
the development of such corpuscles, in some suitable
apparatus, into distinct organisms. But any such
development, he distinctly states, he never witnessed.
He <span class="nowrap">says<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></span>:&mdash;“What would have been the better and
more direct course would have been to follow the
development of these germs with the microscope.
Such was my intention; but the apparatus which I
had devised for this purpose not having been delivered
to me at a convenient time, I was diverted from this
investigation by other work.” The evidence which
he does adduce, in subsequent portions of his memoir,
in order to prove that some of these corpuscles were
really “fertile germs,” is almost valueless, because all
the facts are open to another interpretation, which is
just as much, nay, even more, in accordance with Baron
Liebig’s than with his own doctrine of fermentation.</p>

<p>But another most important consideration presents
itself. M. Pasteur’s researches as to the nature of
the dust contained in the atmosphere enable him to
say nothing concerning the presence of <i>Bacteria</i>,
although he himself admits that these are generally<span class="pagenum" title="26"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a></span>
the first organisms which display themselves in fermentations
or putrefactions, and that in a very large
majority of the cases in which fermentation occurs
in closed vessels they are the only organisms which
make their appearance<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></span> And yet, notwithstanding
these facts, M. Pasteur says, in reference to the
common form of <i>Bacterium</i>:&mdash;“This infusorial animal
is so small that one cannot distinguish its germ, and
still less fix upon the presence of this germ, if it were
known, amongst the organized corpuscles of the dust
which is suspended in the air.”</p>

<p>Here, then, we have a confession from M. Pasteur
himself, that all evidence fails, where it is most wanted,
in support of his hypothesis.</p>

<p>If a large number of fermentations begin with the
presence of <i>Bacteria</i> as the only living things, and if
in a number of cases no other organisms ever occur, it
is useless to adduce as evidence, in proof of the view
that fermentations are <i>always</i> initiated by air-derived
organisms, the fact that certain corpuscles (supposed
to be spores of fungi) are recognizable in the atmosphere&mdash;capped
by the distinct <span class="nowrap">statement<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></span> that
<i>Bacteria</i> or their germs are not recognizable. If <i>Bacteria</i>
are not recognizable in the atmosphere, what
scientific evidence is there that the fermentations in
which these alone occur are initiated by <i>Bacteria</i>
derived from the atmosphere, or from certain imagi<span class="pagenum" title="27"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a></span>nary
<i>Bacteria</i> germs<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></span> which we are supposed to be
unable to distinguish? M. Pasteur may, moreover,
be reminded that when he resorts to the supposition
of <i>Bacteria</i> possessing “germs” which are indistinguishable,
he is again resorting to hypothesis rather
than to fact, in order to prove the truth of the
particular doctrine of fermentation which he advocates.
<i>Bacteria</i> are known to reproduce and multiply
only by a process of fission; each of the parts into
which they divide being nothing more than a part of
the original <i>Bacterium</i>, and therefore endowed with
similar properties of resisting heat, desiccation, and
other agencies. Any resort to invisible germs to
account for the multiplication of <i>Bacteria</i>, which are
known to reproduce freely in other ways, is obviously
not permissible, unless such postulation be more or
less necessitated by the occurrence of facts otherwise
inexplicable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="28"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a></span></p>

<p>Although, therefore, no direct evidence has been
adduced tending to show that <i>Bacteria</i> are present
in the atmosphere, even if this evidence had been
forthcoming, it would have been necessary, in reference
to M. Pasteur’s hypothesis, for it to be supplemented
by further evidence to the effect that <i>Bacteria</i> were
well capable of resisting such an amount of desiccation
as must have been involved by their presence for an
indefinite time in the atmosphere even of the hottest
and driest regions of the earth. For, organic substances
in solution do not only putrefy in moist
weather or moist climates; they putrefy most rapidly
and surely when the temperature is high, and quite
irrespectively of the amount of moisture contained
in the atmosphere. A property of resisting the
effects of desiccation&mdash;the possession of which, by
<i>Bacteria</i>, is so necessary for the truth of M. Pasteur’s
argument&mdash;ought to have been shown by scientific
evidence to be a real attribute of such organisms;
though it seems, on the contrary, to have been
assumed to exist, with almost equal readiness by both
parties, in the controversies concerning the possibility
of “spontaneous generation.” This error may be
ascribed to the misguiding influence of a treacherous
analogy. Whilst it may be true that certain seeds
and spores, and also that Rotifers, “Sloths,” and some
Nematoids are capable of resisting the influence of a
prolonged exposure to desiccating influences, it may
well be asked, whether the same fact necessarily holds<span class="pagenum" title="29"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a></span>
good for organisms such as <i>Bacteria</i>, which have no
chitinous or other envelopes to protect them, and
which are merely minute fragments of naked protoplasm.
Having <span class="nowrap">elsewhere<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></span> shown how far presumptions
had stolen a march upon established facts, in
reference to the supposed possession of a similar property
by the Free Nematoids, my eyes were opened
to the reality of this uncertainty with regard to <i>Bacteria</i>.
It is, however, no easy matter definitely to
prove or to disprove the possession of this property
by organisms so minute as <i>Bacteria</i>, and therefore so
difficult to identify. If dried <i>Bacteria</i> are added to a
drop of a suitable solution&mdash;similar to that in which
they had been bred&mdash;it soon becomes quite impossible
to distinguish those which have been added
from those which arise in the fluid. Taking into consideration
the fate of other simple organisms, however,
it is by no means improbable that they should be
killed even by a short desiccation. I have found, for
instance, that desiccation for half-an-hour in a room
at a temperature of 65°&nbsp;F. suffices to kill all the larger,
naked, lower organisms with which I have ex­peri­men­ted&mdash;in­clud­ing
long Vibrios, Amœbæ, Monads,
Chlamydomonads, Euglenæ, Desmids, Vorticellæ and
all other Ciliated Infusoria.</p>

<p>But, certain indirect evidence seems to speak
most authoritatively against the supposition that the<span class="pagenum" title="30"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a></span>
air contains any notable quantity of living <i>Bacteria</i>,
or <i>Bacteria</i> germs, whether visible or invisible. I
have always found that a simple solution of ammonic
tartrate, which has been placed&mdash;without previous
boiling&mdash;in a corked bottle of greater capacity, will
become turbid in two or three days, owing to the
presence of myriads of <i>Bacteria</i>; whilst a similar
solution, previously boiled, may remain for ten days,
three weeks, or more, without showing the least trace
of turbidity, although the open neck of the bottle or
flask in which it is contained, may be covered only by
a loose cap of paper. And yet, at any time, in order to
make this fluid become turbid in from 24 to 48 hours,
all that one has to do is to bring it into contact with
a small glass rod which has just been dipped into a
solution containing living <i>Bacteria</i><span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></span></p>

<p>If we find that an eminently inoculable fluid will
remain for two or three weeks, or perhaps more,
in contact with the air without becoming turbid,
though it will always become turbid in two or three
days if brought into contact with living <i>Bacteria</i>, what
can we conclude, but that living <i>Bacteria</i> are not very
common in the atmosphere? These most striking
facts can be easily verified by other observers.</p>

<p>Thus we find ourselves, at present, in this position.
After all that has been said and done to prove the
wonderful prevalence of “germs” in the atmosphere,<span class="pagenum" title="31"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a></span>
we are really still in the region of hypothesis&mdash;no
further advanced than we were in the time of Bonnet
and of Spallanzani, so far as it concerns the organisms
which are all important&mdash;<i>Bacteria</i>. Neither these
nor their germs have been shown to exist in any
recognizable abundance in the atmosphere, and yet
in most fermentations they are the first organisms
which display themselves; whilst in many such
fermentations <i>Bacteria</i> alone occur. Nay more, even
were they present in any great abundance, there is
some reason to believe that the majority of them
would exist as mere dead, organic particles&mdash;because
<i>Bacteria</i> are more than likely to be unable to resist
anything like an extreme or prolonged exposure to
desiccating influences.</p>

<p>The first and essential data in support of M.&nbsp;Pasteur’s
hypothesis must, therefore, be regarded as
entirely unproved in respect to <i>Bacteria</i>&mdash;which are
the most important of all organisms, in relation to
the cause of fermentation and putrefaction.</p>

<p>Without the aid of elaborate experiments, however,
the evidence which the microscope can supply is
capable of leading us to the conclusion that such
search for atmospheric <i>Bacteria</i> germs, was comparatively
useless. If it can be shown that <i>Bacteria</i>
can arise in a fluid independently of <i>visible</i> germs,
then, obviously, any inquiries as to the nature of the
visible contents of the atmosphere, can have only a
very indirect bearing upon the question as to the<span class="pagenum" title="32"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a></span>
mode of origin of these organisms. And yet by the
aid of the microscope, as I have elsewhere stated,
one can watch the appearance of almost motionless
specks, more or less uniformly diffused through a
motionless film of fluid, and can see them gradually
develop into moving <i>Bacteria</i> or into <i>Torulæ</i>. So that,
where no <i>visible</i> germs previously existed, visible particles
of living matter develop, and more or less rapidly
grow into distinct <i>Bacteria</i>. This may be best seen in
a drop of a fresh and very strong turnip infusion, which
has been filtered several times through the finest paper.
The drop, placed in a live-box, should be flattened
into a thin film by the application of the cover.</p>

<p>Thus protected, evaporation takes place very
slowly, and with the live-box resting on one of
Stricker’s hot-water plates, at a temperature of 85° to
90°&nbsp;F., and the latter upon the stage of the microscope,
one can easily select a portion of the field in
which either no particles or only a countable number
exist. If, therefore, around and between any mere
granules which may pre-exist, or in a clear space, one
gradually sees in the course of two or perhaps three
hours, a multitude of almost motionless specks (at first
about <span class="nowrap"> <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">100000</span></span><span class="prime">″</span></span> in diameter) in positions where no such
specks previously existed; and if these specks may
be seen gradually to increase in size and develop
into <i>Bacteria</i> and <i>Torulæ</i>, then, at all events, we are
able to say that these organisms can be developed
without pre-existing <i>visible</i> germs, and we have<span class="pagenum" title="33"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a></span>
just the same amount of actual evidence for believing
that they have been formed <i>de novo</i>, as we should
have for believing that crystals had been formed <i>de
novo</i>, if we had seen them appearing under our eyes in
the same manner. Whether they really arise after the
fashion of crystals, without the aid of pre-existing
though invisible germs, is a matter which can only be
settled inferentially, by a subsequent resort to strict
methods of experimentation.</p>

<p>Seeing however, that we are able, with the aid of
the microscope alone, to demonstrate that <i>Bacteria</i>
and <i>Torulæ</i> can develop in situations where no visible
germs had previously existed, it is useless, as I have
said before&mdash;so far as the question of their mode of
origin is concerned&mdash;to search the atmosphere to ascertain
what visible germs it may contain. If some <i>Bacteria</i>
and <i>Torulæ</i> arise from germs at all, it must be
from germs which are invisible to us. The finding of
visible germs in the atmosphere can, therefore, only
have an indirect bearing upon the solution of the problem.
Since it <i>can</i> be shown that some visible spores
and ova exist in the atmosphere, this affords a certain
amount of warrant for the supposition that invisible,
living, reproductive particles may also exist&mdash;more
especially if the existence of an amount of organic
matter, which is ordinarily invisible, can be revealed
in the air, by the agency of the electric beam, or by
any other means.</p>

<p>Nothing can be more illegitimate, however, in the<span class="pagenum" title="34"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a></span>
way of inference, than the assumption at once indulged
in by Prof. Tyndall and others (who might have been
expected, by their previous scientific work, to have
learned more caution) that this impalpable organic dust
was largely composed of impalpable germs. Yet, without
a shadow of proof, without even an attempt to
prove it, the air was for a time represented to be a
mere stirabout, thick with invisible germs. The
briefest reflection, however, upon the probabilities of
the case, should have sufficed to suggest a totally different
interpretation. The surface of the earth is
clothed with living things of all kinds, animal and
vegetal, which are not only continually throwing off
organic particles and fragments during their life, but
are constantly undergoing processes of decay and molecular
disintegration after their death. The actual reproductive
elements of these living things are extremely
small in bulk, when compared with the other
parts which are not reproductive, and although <i>Bacteria</i>
and <i>Torulæ</i> do exist abundantly, and do materially help
to bring about some of the decay in question, yet their
bulk, also, is extremely small in comparison with the
amount of organic matter itself that is continually
undergoing disintegration of a dry kind, in which
<i>Bacteria</i> and <i>Torulæ</i> take no part. When, moreover,
it is considered that in the neighbourhood of populous
cities (the air of which alone exhibits this very large
quantity of impalpable, mixed with palpable, organic
dust), there is constantly going on a wear and tear of<span class="pagenum" title="35"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a></span>
the textile fabrics and of the organic products of
various kinds which are daily subservient to the wants
of man; and that the chimneys of manufactories and
dwelling-houses are also continually emitting clouds
of smoke thick with imperfectly consumed organic
particles, some idea may be gained of the manifold
sources whence the organic particles and fragments
found in the atmosphere may emanate, and also as to
what proportion of them is likely to be composed of
living or dead reproductive elements, or “germs.”</p>

<p>Thus, then, so far as the two rival doctrines of fermentation
are concerned, the investigation of the
nature of the solid particles contained in the atmosphere
has revealed facts which are thoroughly in
harmony with all the requirements of Liebig’s physical
theory, though it has almost utterly failed to give
anything like a scientific basis to the vital theory of
Pasteur. So far from being able to show that living
<i>Bacteria</i> (which are the first and oftentimes the only
organisms concerned in many processes of fermentation
and putrefaction) are universally diffused through
the air, Pasteur admits that these cannot be detected,
and that their “germs” are not recognizable.</p>

<p>If, therefore, M. Pasteur still maintains the truth of
his theory, it should be distinctly understood that it
rests originally, not upon established facts, but upon
a mere hypothesis&mdash;the hypothesis that the air teems
with multitudes of invisible <i>Bacteria</i> germs. He is
driven to such a doctrine, not only by his own con<span class="pagenum" title="36"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a></span>fessions
concerning <i>Bacteria</i>, but also by the microscopical
evidence to which I have referred.</p>

<p>So that in explaining the results of any experiments
made with the view of throwing light upon the
<i>cause</i> of fermentation or putrefaction, it is especially
necessary to bear in mind two considerations:&mdash;</p>

<p>I. That dust filtered from the atmosphere cannot
be proved to include living <i>Bacteria</i>; though it is
known to contain a multitude of organic particles
which may be capable in the presence of water, in accordance
with Liebig’s hypothesis, of acting as ferments.</p>

<p>II. It must also be recollected that, in the opinion
of many, Life represents a higher function which is
displayed by certain kinds of organic matter; and that
this higher function may be deteriorated or rendered
non-existent by an amount of heat which might not
be adequate to decompose the organic matter itself.</p>

<p>It is all the more necessary to call attention to
these two considerations, because M. Pasteur invariably
speaks as though it had been established that
the air contains multitudes of living <i>Bacteria</i>, when,
really, he had only proved that the air contains a
number of corpuscles resembling spores of fungi, &amp;c.
And, as I have already intimated, the existence of
spores of fungi in the atmosphere, however well
established, is of little or no importance as an explanation
of the cause of a very large number of
fermentations. Their presence is even of still less importance,
owing to the fact of the co-existence with<span class="pagenum" title="37"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a></span>
these fungus-spores, of multitudes of organic fragments,
which&mdash;in accordance with the views of Liebig,
Gerhardt, and other chemists&mdash;are capable of acting
as ferments. To this latter consideration M. Pasteur
never even alludes when he speaks (<i>loc. cit.</i> p.&nbsp;40) of his
“ensemencements,” and of other experiments which
are equally, or even more, capable of being interpreted
in accordance with Liebig’s views than with his own.</p>

<p>Bearing these considerations in mind, we shall be in
a better position to enquire into the real interpretation
that may be given to many of M. Pasteur’s results,
and into the question as to how far the facts which he
records are favourable to his own, or to the adverse
doctrine concerning the causes of fermentation.</p>

<p class="mt2em">In the memoir so often alluded to on “The Organized
Corpuscles which exist in the Atmosphere,” M.&nbsp;Pasteur
adduced various kinds of evidence, tending,
as he thought, to show that the first <i>Bacteria</i> which
make their appearance in putrefying or fermenting solutions,
have been derived from living <i>Bacteria</i> or their
“germs,” which pre-existed in the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Some of the experiments by which he endeavoured
to substantiate this position were of a very
simple nature. Their narration attracted much attention
at the time, as it was supposed that by their
means M. Pasteur had&mdash;as he pro­fessed&mdash;con­clu­sive­ly
shown the erroneousness of the views of those
who believed in what was called <span class="pagenum" title="38"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a></span>“spontaneous generation.”
These experiments were soon repeated by
other observers, who, using different fluids, obtained
quite opposite results. Thus it became obvious to
impartial critics, that whilst the means adopted by
M. Pasteur might be adequate to check the processes
of fermentation or putrefaction in certain fluids, they
were quite powerless to effect this when many other
fluids were employed.</p>

<p>These particular experiments, however, still seem
to exercise a very great influence on the minds of many
in this country, who are either unaware of, or disbelieve
in, the possibility of obtaining opposite results.</p>

<p>The chapter in which M. Pasteur detailed these
experiments is thus entitled:&mdash;“<i>Another very simple
method of demonstrating that all the organized products
of Infusions (previously heated) owe their origin to the
corpuscles which exist suspended in the Atmosphere.</i>”
Whilst claiming to have already rigorously established
the validity of this conclusion by the experiments
described in previous chapters, M. Pasteur adds:&mdash;“If
there remained the least doubt on this subject, in the
mind of the reader, it would be dissipated by the experiments
of which I am now about to speak.” (p.&nbsp;66.)</p>

<p>Sweetened yeast-water, urine, infusions of pear and
of beetroot, were placed in flasks with long necks,
variously drawn out and bent. The flasks were subsequently
treated as follows. M. Pasteur says:&mdash;“I
then raise the liquid to the boiling-point for several
minutes until steam issues abundantly from the ex<span class="pagenum" title="39"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a></span>tremity
of the drawn-out neck of the flask, which is
permitted to remain open. I then allow the flask to
cool. But, singular fact&mdash;and one well calculated to
astonish every one acquainted with the delicacy of the
experiments relating to what is called ‘spontaneous
generation’&mdash;the liquid of this flask will remain indefinitely
without alteration. The flask may be handled
without any fear, it may be transported from place to
place, allowed to experience all the seasonal variations
of temperature, and its liquid does not undergo the
slightest alteration, whilst it preserves its odour and its
taste.” If, however, the neck of one of these flasks be
broken off close to the flask itself, then, according to
M. Pasteur, the previously unaltered fluid will, in a
day or two, undergo the ordinary changes, and swarm
with <i>Bacteria</i> and <i>Mucedineæ</i>.</p>

<p>“The great interest of this method is,” M. Pasteur
adds, “that it completes, unanswerably, the proof that
the origin of life in infusions which have been raised
to the boiling point, is solely due to the solid <span class="nowrap">particles<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></span>
which are suspended in the air.” He believes that any
living things pre-existing in the fluid itself would be
destroyed by the high temperature to which it had been
raised; and that those contained in the air of the flask
would also be destroyed, if not expelled, by the process
<span class="pagenum" title="40"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a></span>of ebullition. Believing that the air is the source of
germs from which Life is first developed in infusions,
he thinks that what rapidly enters at first, on the
cessation of ebullition, has its germs destroyed by
contact with the almost boiling liquid; whilst the air
which enters subsequently, and more slowly, is supposed
to deposit its germs in the various flexures of
the tubes, so that none are able to reach the fluid
itself. Infusions, thus protected, do not undergo putrefaction,
says M. Pasteur, because the access of pre-existing
living things is necessary for the initiation of
this change, and such access is prevented by the tortuous
and bent neck of the flask.</p>

<p>Others say that <i>some</i> fluids submitted to the conditions
mentioned, will undergo putrefactive changes,
and that, therefore, these experiments of M. Pasteur
are utterly incapable of settling the general question
as to the cause of fermentation and putrefaction, and
also that concerning the origin of Life. Although
acknowledging a certain difficulty in explaining the
results which are sometimes attained by this method,
some of us would rather confess this than confidently
offer explanations&mdash;as M. Pasteur did&mdash;which may in
a short time be stultified by the results of other experiments
with different fluids.</p>

<p>Having previously <span class="nowrap">shown<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></span> that living things could
appear and multiply in such a flask as M. Pasteur<span class="pagenum" title="41"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a></span>
describes&mdash;in any flask, in fact,&mdash;which had been hermetically
sealed during the ebullition of a suitable fluid
within; this was deemed to be a result so contradictory
to the explanations of M. Pasteur, that it appeared
needless to add my testimony, as I could have done,
to that of M. Victor Meunier and others, as to the
different results obtainable by operating, in M. Pasteur’s
fashion, with different fluids. It seemed to me
that if organisms were to be procured in flasks from
which air had been altogether expelled, it was useless
still to urge the preservative virtues of any process of
filtration of air&mdash;with the object of showing that living
things in infusions derived their origin from atmospheric
germs. Obviously, if there were no atmosphere,
there could be no atmospheric germs present; and if
living things were, nevertheless, developed under these
exclusive circumstances, how could M. Pasteur or his
disciples still expect to convince others that the first
living things in infusions always proceeded from pre-existing
atmospheric germs&mdash;even although it could
be shown, that in many cases, when these were filtered
off by flasks with narrow and tortuous necks, no
living things were developed in such fluids. Granting
to the full the truth of such facts, they could do
nothing to establish the doctrine of the origin of infusorial
life from pre-existing atmospheric germs, so long
as it could also be shown that living things might be
developed in boiled solutions to which air, instead of
being filtered, was never allowed to enter at all.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="42"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a></span></p>
<p>It is not, therefore, because I think that some of the
experiments which will subsequently be related afford
any stronger or more direct support to my own conclusions,
but because I think they may do this indirectly&mdash;by
shaking the faith of many in some of the
reasonings of M. Pasteur&mdash;that I am induced to give
an account of them<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></span></p>

<p>What has been hitherto said, also applies to the more
recent statements concerning the efficacy of cotton-wool
as an agent for filtering germs from the atmosphere.
Prof. Huxley says he has never seen putrefaction or
fermentation occur after certain organic fluids have
been boiled for ten or fifteen minutes, if a good plug
of cotton-wool has been inserted into the neck of the
flask in which they are contained whilst ebullition is
going on, and has, subsequently, been allowed to remain
in the same situation. Using other or perhaps stronger
fluids, however, I have found that such a method of
proceeding is by no means adequate to stop the growth
and development of organisms. And, also, even if it
had been always efficacious&mdash;the reason adduced
could not hold good, in the face of my other experiments,
which had shown that a development of life
might go on in cases where the air, which had been
similarly driven out, was subsequently, in place of<span class="pagenum" title="43"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a></span>
being filtered, prevented from gaining access to the
fluid.</p>

<p>If germs derived from the air are the sole causes of
putrefaction, then, surely, deprivation from air ought
to be just as efficacious as any process of filtration of
air&mdash;more especially when the filtration or the deprivation
have a common starting point. And the mode
of procedure, in both cases, is precisely the same up to
a certain point. A fluid is boiled for a short time
in order to kill the germs which may be within the
flask, and to expel its previously contained air. At
a certain stage of the ebullition, this may be arrested,
if we have to do with a bent-neck flask, or one
whose neck is plugged with cotton-wool, and no
change, it is said, will subsequently take place in the
contained fluid, because the air which enters is, by
either of these means, filtered from its germs. But
if, whilst ebullition continued, the neck of the flask
had been hermetically sealed&mdash;so as altogether to
prevent the re-ingress of air&mdash;and if the fluid, thus
contained <i>in vacuo</i>, would nevertheless undergo fermentation,
obviously the former explanation must be
altogether shelved.</p>

<p>In the face of M. Pasteur’s explanations, and those of
Professor Huxley, these frequent positive results with
fluids contained <i>in vacuo</i> are absolutely contradictory.
There may naturally arise, therefore, a very grave doubt
as to the validity of the explanation adduced by M.&nbsp;Pasteur,
and adopted by Professor Huxley and others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="44"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a></span></p>

<p>All these experiments to which I have been alluding
are based upon the supposition (assented to by Pasteur
and Huxley) that <i>Bacteria</i> which pre-existed in
the solution would certainly be destroyed by its being
raised for a few minutes to a temperature of 212°&nbsp;F.
This conclusion is, I believe, perfectly correct<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></span> and in
support thereof I will adduce the following additional
information.</p>


<h4><i>Limits of ‘Vital Resistance’ to Heat displayed by
Bacteria and Torulæ.</i></h4>

<p>After stating <span class="nowrap">elsewhere<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></span>, that <i>Vibriones</i> are partly
broken up or disintegrated by an exposure for a few
minutes to a temperature of 212°&nbsp;F. in an infusion
which is being boiled, and also that, in all probability,
the life of <i>Bacteria</i> would be destroyed by such a
treatment, I made the following remarks:&mdash;“With
reference to these organisms, however, one caution is
necessary to be borne in mind by the experimenter.
The movements of monads and Bacteria may be, and
frequently are, of two kinds. The one variety does
not differ in the least from the mere molecular or
Brownian movement, which may be witnessed in
similarly minute, not-living particles immersed in
fluids. Whilst the other seems to be purely vital&mdash;<span class="pagenum" title="45"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a></span>that
is, dependent upon their properties as living
things. These vital movements are altogether different
from the mere dancing oscillations which not-living
particles display, as may be seen when the
monad or Bacterium darts about over comparatively
large areas, so as frequently to disappear from the
field. After an infusion has been exposed for a second
or two to the boiling temperature, these vital movements
no longer occur, though almost all the monads
and Bacteria may be seen to display the Brownian
movement in a well-marked degree. They seem to
be reduced by the shortest exposure to a temperature
of 100°&nbsp;C. to the condition of mere not-living particles,
and then they become subjected to the unimpaired
influence of the physical conditions which
determine these movements.” I now have various
facts to add in confirmation of these conclusions, and
in extension of our knowledge concerning the vital
resistance to heat of <i>Bacteria</i> and <i>Torulæ</i>.</p>

<p>It would be a most important step if we could
ascertain some means by which these primary movements
of living <i>Bacteria</i> might be distinguished from
the secondary, or communicated, movements of not-living
particles. In many cases, organisms that are
truly living may only exhibit very languid movements,
which, as movements, are quite indistinguishable from
those that the same <i>Bacteria</i> may display when they
are really dead. Because the movements, therefore,
are of this doubtful character, persons are apt, unfairly,<span class="pagenum" title="46"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a></span>
to argue that the <i>Bacteria</i> which present them, are no
more living than are the minute particles of carbon
obtained from the flame of a lamp, which may exhibit
similar movements. This, however, is a point of view
which becomes obviously misleading if too much stress
is laid upon it; and it is more especially so in this
case, when those <i>Bacteria</i> which display the most
characteristic sign of vitality&mdash;viz., “spontaneous”
division or reproduction&mdash;do, at the time, almost
always exhibit only the same languid movements.
Mobility is, in fact, not an essential characteristic of
living <i>Bacteria</i>, whilst <i>the occurrence of the act of reproduction
is the most indubitable sign of their life</i>. It
should be remembered, therefore, that any <i>Bacteria</i>
which are almost motionless, or which exhibit mere
Brownian movements, <i>may</i> be living, whilst those
which spontaneously divide and reproduce, are certainly
alive&mdash;whatever may be the kind of movement
they present.</p>

<p>In any particular case, however, can we decide
whether <i>Bacteria</i>, that have been submitted to a given
temperature, and which exhibit movements resembling
those known as Brownian, are really dead or
living? If the movements are primary, or dependent
upon the inherent molecular activity of the organism
itself, they ought, it might be argued, to continue
when the molecules of the fluid are at rest; if, on the
other hand, they are mere secondary or communicated
movements, impressed upon the organisms as they<span class="pagenum" title="47"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a></span>
would be upon any other similarly minute particles,
by the molecular oscillations of the fluid in which they
are contained, then the movements ought to grow less,
and gradually cease, as the fluid approaches a state of
molecular rest&mdash;if this be attainable. Following out
this idea, some months ago, I first tested the correctness
of the assumption by experimenting with fluids
containing various kinds of not-living particles; such
as carbon-particles from the flame of a lamp, or freshly
precipitated baric sulphate. However perfect may
have been the Brownian movements when portions of
these fluids were first examined beneath a covering-glass,
they always gradually diminished, after the
specimen had been mounted by surrounding the
covering-glass with some cement or varnish. Thus
prepared, no evaporation could take place from the
thin film of fluid, and after one, three, four, or more
hours&mdash;the slide remaining undisturbed&mdash;most of
the particles had subsided, and were found to have
come to a state of rest. In order still further to test
these views, I took an infusion of turnip, containing
a multitude of <i>Bacteria</i> whose movements were
of the languid description, and divided it into two
portions. One of these portions was boiled for about
a minute, whilst the other was not interfered with.
Then, after the boiled solution had been cooled, a
drop was taken from each and placed at some little
distance from one another on the same glass slip;
covering-glasses half an inch in diameter were laid<span class="pagenum" title="48"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a></span>
on, and the superfluous fluid beneath each was removed
by a piece of blotting-paper. When only
the thinnest film of fluid was left, the covering-glasses
were surrounded by a thick, quickly-drying
cement<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></span> Examined with the microscope immediately
afterwards, it was generally found that the <i>Bacteria</i>
which had been boiled presented a shrunken and
shrivelled aspect&mdash;whilst some of them were more
or less disintegrated&mdash;though, as far as movement
was concerned, there was little to distinguish that
which they manifested, from that of their plumper-looking
relatives which had not been boiled.</p>

<p>If the specimens were examined again after twenty-four
or more hours, there was still very little difference
perceptible between them, as regards their movements.
And the same was the case when the specimens
were examined after a lapse of some days or
weeks. One important difference does, however, soon
become obvious. The <i>Bacteria</i> which have not been
boiled, undergo a most unmistakeable increase within
their imprisoned habitat; whilst those which have been
boiled, do not increase. The two films may be almost
colourless at first (if the <i>Bacteria</i> are not very abundant),
but after a few days, that composed of unboiled fluid
begins to show an obvious and increasing cloudiness,<span class="pagenum" title="49"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a></span>
which is never manifested by the other. Microscopical
examination shows that this cloudiness is due to
a proportionate increase in the number of <i>Bacteria</i>.</p>

<p>Is the continuance of the movements of the organisms
which had been boiled attributable to their
extreme lightness, and to the slight difference between
their specific gravity and that of the fluid in which
they are immersed? I soon became convinced that
this was one, if not the chief reason, when I found
that <i>Bacteria</i> which had been submitted to very much
higher temperatures, behaved in precisely the same
manner as those which had been merely boiled, and
also that other particles which&mdash;though obviously
dead&mdash;had a similar specific lightness, also continued
to exhibit their Brownian movements for days and
weeks. This was the case more especially with the
minute fat particles in a mounted specimen of boiled
milk<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></span> and also with very minute particles which were
gradually <span class="nowrap">precipitated<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></span> from a hay infusion that had
been heated to 302°&nbsp;F. for four hours. Trials with many
different substances, indeed, after a time convinced me
that the most rapid cessation of Brownian movements<span class="pagenum" title="50"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a></span>
in stationary films<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></span> occurred where the particles were
heavy or large; and that the duration of the movement
was more and more prolonged, as the particles
experimented with, were lighter or more minute.
So that, when we have to do with <i>Bacteria</i>, the minute
oil globules of milk, or with other similarly light particles,
the movements continue for an indefinite time,
and are, in part, mere exponents of the molecular
unrest of the fluid. They are always capable of being
increased or renewed by the incidence of heat or other
disturbing agencies.</p>

<p>In respect of the movements which they may exhibit,
therefore, really living, though languid, <i>Bacteria</i>,
cannot always be discriminated from dead <i>Bacteria</i>.
Both may only display mere Brownian movements.</p>

<p>It becomes obvious, then, that in doubtful cases we
ought not to rely very strongly upon the character of
their movements, as evidence of the death of <i>Bacteria</i>&mdash;although
these may frequently be of so extensive
a nature as to render it not at all doubtful whether
the <i>Bacteria</i> which display them are living. In the
experiments which I am about to relate, we shall be
able to pronounce that the <i>Bacteria</i> are living or dead,
by reference to the continuance or cessation of their
most essentially vital characteristic. If <i>Bacteria</i> fail
to multiply in a suitable fluid, and under suitable con<span class="pagenum" title="51"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a></span>ditions,
we have the best proof that can be obtained
of their death.</p>

<p>Having made many experiments with solutions of
ammonic tartrate and sodic phosphate, I have almost
invariably observed that such solutions&mdash;when exposed
to the air without having been boiled&mdash;become turbid
in the course of a few days owing to the presence of
myriads of <i>Bacteria</i> and <i>Vibriones</i>, with some <i>Torulæ</i>.
These organisms seem to appear and multiply in such
a solution almost as readily as they do in an organic
infusion. On the other hand, having frequently boiled
such solutions, and closed the flasks during ebullition,
I have invariably found, on subsequent examination
of these fluids, that whatever else may have been met
with, <i>Bacteria</i> and <i>Vibriones</i> were always absent. The
difference was most notable, and it seemed only intelligible
on the supposition that any living <i>Bacteria</i> or
dead ferments which may have pre-existed in the
solution, were deprived of their virtues by the preliminary
boiling. These experiments also seemed to
show that such solutions, after having been boiled, and
shut up in hermetically-sealed flasks, from which all
air had been expelled, were quite incapable of giving
birth to <i>Bacteria</i>. The unboiled fluid, exposed to the
air, might have become turbid, because it was able to
nourish any living <i>Bacteria</i> which it may have contained,
or because it was capable of evolving these <i>de
novo</i>, under the influence of dead ferments whose activity
had not been destroyed by heat. Hence we have<span class="pagenum" title="52"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a></span>
a fluid which is eminently suitable for testing the vital
resistance of <i>Bacteria</i>,&mdash;one which, although quite
capable of nourishing and favouring their reproduction,
does not appear capable of evolving them, when,
after previous ebullition, it is enclosed in a hermetically
sealed flask from which all air has been
expelled. Three flasks were half-filled with this solution<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></span>
The neck of the first (<i>a</i>) was allowed to remain
open, and no addition was made to the fluid. To the
second (<i>b</i>), after it had been boiled and had become
cool, was added half a minim of a similar saline solution,
which had been previously exposed to the air,
and which was quite turbid with <i>Bacteria</i>, <i>Vibriones</i>
and <i>Torulæ</i>. From this flask&mdash;after its inoculation
with the living organisms&mdash;the air was exhausted
by means of an air-pump, and its neck was hermetically
sealed during the ebullition of the fluid, without
the flask and its contents having been exposed to a
heat of more than 90°&nbsp;F. The third flask (<i>c</i>) was
similarly inoculated with living <i>Bacteria</i>, although its
contents were boiled for ten minutes (at 212°&nbsp;F.), and
its neck was hermetically sealed during ebullition. The
results were as follows:&mdash;the solution in the first flask
(<i>a</i>), became turbid in four or five days; the solution
in the second (<i>b</i>), became turbid after thirty-six hours;
whilst that in the third flask (<i>c</i>), remained perfectly<span class="pagenum" title="53"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a></span>
clear. This latter flask was opened on the twelfth
day, whilst its contents were still clear, and on microscopical
examination of the fluid no living <i>Bacteria</i>
were to be found. This particular experiment was
repeated three times with similarly negative results,
although on two occasions the fluid was only boiled
for one minute instead of ten.</p>

<p>It seemed, moreover, that by having recourse to experiments
of the same kind, the exact degree of heat,
which is fatal to <i>Bacteria</i> and <i>Torulæ</i> might be ascertained.
I accordingly endeavoured to determine
this point. Portions of the same saline solution,
after having been <span class="nowrap">boiled<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></span> and allowed to cool,
were similarly inoculated with a <span class="nowrap">drop<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></span> of very
turbid fluid, containing hundreds of living <i>Bacteria</i>,
<i>Vibriones</i>, and <i>Torulæ</i>. A drying apparatus was fixed
to an air-pump, and the flask containing the inoculated
fluid was securely connected with the former by
means of a piece of tight india-rubber tubing<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a></span> after
its neck had been drawn out and narrowed, at about
two inches from the extremity. The flask containing<span class="pagenum" title="54"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a></span>
the inoculated fluid was then allowed to dip into a
beaker holding water at 122°&nbsp;F., in which a thermometer
was immersed. The temperature of the fluid was maintained
at this point for fifteen minutes<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a></span> by means of a
spirit lamp beneath the beaker. The air was then
exhausted from the flask by means of the pump, till
the fluid began to boil; ebullition was allowed to continue
for a minute or two, so as to expel as much air
as possible from the flask, and then, during its continuance,
the narrowed neck of the flask was hermetically
sealed by means of a spirit-lamp flame and a blowpipe.
Other flasks were similarly prepared, except
that they were exposed to successively higher degrees
of heat&mdash;the fluid being boiled off, in different cases,
at temperatures of 131°, 140°, 149°, 158°, and 167°&nbsp;F.
All the flasks being similarly inoculated with living
<i>Bacteria</i>, <i>Vibriones</i>, and <i>Torulæ</i>, and similarly sealed
during ebullition, they differed from one another only
in respect to the degree of heat to which they had
been submitted. Their bulbs were subsequently placed
in a water bath, which during both day and night was
maintained at a temperature of from 85° to 95°&nbsp;F.
The results have been as follows:&mdash;The flasks whose
contents had been heated to 122° and 131°&nbsp;F. respectively,
began to exhibit a bluish tinge in the
contained fluid after the first or second day; and<span class="pagenum" title="55"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a></span>
after two or three more days, the fluid in each became
quite turbid and opaque, owing to the presence and
multiplication of myriads of <i>Bacteria</i>, <i>Vibriones</i> and
<i>Torulæ</i>; the fluids in the flasks, however, which had
been exposed to the higher temperature of 140°, 149°,
158°, and 167°&nbsp;F., showed not the slightest trace of
turbidity, and no diminution in the clearness of the
fluid while they were kept under observation&mdash;that
is, for a period of twelve or fourteen days. One kind
of conclusion only is to be drawn from these experiments,
the conditions of which were in every way
similar, except as regards the degree of heat to which
the inoculated fluids were subjected&mdash;seeing that the
organisms were contained in a fluid, which had been
proved to be eminently suitable for their growth and
multiplication<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></span> If inoculated fluids which have been
raised to 122° and 131°&nbsp;F. for ten minutes, are found
in the course of a few days to become turbid, then,
obviously, the organisms cannot have been killed
by such exposure; whilst, if similar fluids, similarly
inoculated, which have been raised to temperatures
of 140°, 149°, 158°, and 167°&nbsp;F. remain sterile, such
sterility can only be explained by the supposition
that the organisms have been killed by exposure to
these temperatures.</p>

<p>Some of these experiments have been repeated<span class="pagenum" title="56"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a></span>
several times with the same results. On three occasions,
I have found the fluid speedily become turbid,
which had only been exposed to 131°&nbsp;F. for ten
minutes, whilst on three other occasions I have found
the inoculated fluid remain clear, after it had been
exposed to a heat of 140°&nbsp;F. for ten minutes<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></span></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="57"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a></span></p>
<p>In experimenting upon rather higher organisms,
with which there is little difficulty in ascertaining, by
microscopical examination, whether they are living or
dead, I have found that an exposure even to the lower
temperature of 131°&nbsp;F. for five minutes, always suffices
to destroy all signs of life in Vibrios, Amœbæ, Monads,
Chlamydomonads, Euglenæ, Desmids, Vorticellæ,
and all other Ciliated Infusoria which were observed,
as well as in free Nematoids, Rotifers, and
other organisms contained in the fluids which had
been heated.</p>

<p>These results are quite in harmony with the
observations and experiments of M. Pouchet and
of Professor Wyman, as to the capability of resisting
heat displayed by <i>Vibriones</i> and all kinds of ciliated
infusoria. According to the former<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></span> the majority
of ciliated infusoria are killed at, or even below, the
temperature of 122°&nbsp;F., whilst large <i>Vibriones</i> are all
killed at a temperature of 131°&nbsp;F<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></span> According to the
observations of Professor Wyman, the motions of all
ciliated infusoria are stopped at less than 130°&nbsp;F.,
whilst <i>Vibriones</i>, taken from the most various sources,
also seemed to be killed at temperatures between
130°–136.4°&nbsp;F. Similarly, we find Baron Liebig quite
recently making the following remarks concerning
a species of <i>Torula</i>:&mdash;“A temperature of 60°&nbsp;C.
<span class="pagenum" title="58"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a></span>[140°&nbsp;F.] kills the yeast cells; after exposure to this
temperature in water, they no longer undergo fermentation,
and do not cause fermentation in a sugar
solution.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In like manner, active fermentation in
a saccharine liquid is stopped when the liquid is
heated to 60°&nbsp;C., and it does not recommence again
on cooling the liquid.”</p>

<p>That the organisms in question&mdash;being minute naked
portions of living matter&mdash;should be killed by exposure
to the influence of a fluid at these temperatures will
perhaps not seem very improbable to those who have
attempted to keep their fingers for any length of time
in water heated to a similar extent. With watch in
hand I immersed my fingers in one of the experimental
beakers containing water at 131°&nbsp;F., and found that, in
spite of my desires, they were hastily withdrawn, after
an exposure of less than <i>five-and-twenty seconds</i>.</p>

<p>Wishing to ascertain what difference there would
be if the inoculated fluids were exposed for a very
long time, instead of for ten minutes only, to certain
temperatures, I prepared three flasks in the same
manner&mdash;each containing some of the previously
boiled solution, which, when cold, had been inoculated
with living <i>Bacteria</i>, <i>Vibriones</i>, and <i>Torulæ</i>. These
flasks and their contents were then submitted to the
influence of the following conditions:&mdash;One of them
was heated for a few minutes in a beaker containing
water at 113°&nbsp;F., and then by means of the air-pump
a partial vacuum was procured, till the fluid began to<span class="pagenum" title="59"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a></span>
boil. After the remainder of the air had been expelled
by the ebullition of the fluid, the neck of the flask was
hermetically sealed, and the flask itself was subsequently
immersed in the water of the beaker, which
was kept for four hours at a temperature between 113°
and <span class="nowrap">118 <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">2</span></span></span>°&nbsp;F<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></span> The two other flasks similarly prepared
were kept at a temperature of <span class="nowrap">118 <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">2</span></span></span>°&ndash;<span class="nowrap">127 <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">2</span></span></span>°&nbsp;F. for
four hours. In two days, the fluid in the first flask
became slightly turbid, whilst in two days more the
turbidity was most marked. The fluid in the two
other flasks which had been exposed to the temperature
of <span class="nowrap">118 <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">2</span></span></span>°&ndash;<span class="nowrap">127 <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">2</span></span></span>°&nbsp;F. for four hours, remained quite
clear and unaltered during the twelve days in which
they were kept in the warm bath under observation.
These experiments seem to show, therefore, that the
prolongation of the period of exposure to four hours,
suffices to lower the vital resistance to heat of <i>Bacteria</i>
and <i>Torulæ</i> by <span class="nowrap">14 <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">2</span></span></span>°&ndash;18°&nbsp;F.</p>

<p>Such experiments would seem to be most important
and crucial in their nature. They may be
considered to settle the question as to the vital
resistance of these particular <i>Bacteria</i>, whilst other
evidence points conclusively in the direction that
all <i>Bacteria</i>, whencesoever they have been derived,
possess essentially similar vital <span class="nowrap">endowments<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a></span>. Seeing<span class="pagenum" title="60"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a></span>
also that the solutions have been inoculated with a drop
of a fluid in which <i>Bacteria</i>, <i>Vibriones</i>, and <i>Torulæ</i>
are multiplying rapidly, we must suppose that they
are multiplying in their accustomed manner, as much
by the known method of fission, as by any unknown
and assumed method of reproduction. In such a
fluid, at all events, there would be all the kinds of
reproductive elements common to <i>Bacteria</i>, whether
visible or invisible, and these would have been alike
subjected to the influence of the same temperature.
These experiments seem to show, therefore, that even
if <i>Bacteria</i> do multiply by means of invisible gemmules
as well as by the known process of fission, such
invisible particles possess no higher power of resisting
the destructive influence of heat than the parent
<i>Bacteria</i> themselves possess. This result is, more<span class="pagenum" title="61"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a></span>over,
as I venture to think, in accordance with what
might have been anticipated <i>à priori</i>. <i>Bacteria</i> seem
to be composed of homogeneous living matter, and
any gemmule, however minute, could only be a
portion of such living matter, endowed with similar
properties.</p>

<h4><i>Extent to which boiled Fermentable Fluids may be preserved
in Vessels with Bent Necks, or in those whose
Necks are guarded by a Plug of Cotton-Wool.</i></h4>

<p>Having thus satisfied ourselves as to the truth of
the conclusion that <i>Bacteria</i> are killed when the fluid
containing them is boiled (at 212°&nbsp;F.), we are in a position
to proceed with the inquiry as to the evidence
which exists in respect to the statements made by
M. Pasteur, Professor Huxley, and others, that fermentable
fluids which have been boiled, will not undergo
fermentation, either in vessels whose necks have been
many times bent, or in those into whose necks a
plug of cotton-wool has been inserted during the
ebullition of their contained fluid. Organisms are
not found in such cases, they say, because the
“germs” from which the low organisms of infusions
are usually produced, are arrested either in the
flexures of the tube or in the cotton-wool. As I have
before stated, however, it is obvious that if this
explanation be the correct one, the preservation
should be equally well marked in all cases&mdash;quite
irrespectively of the amount of albumenoid or other<span class="pagenum" title="62"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a></span>
nitrogenous material which may be contained in the
fluid. Any exceptions to the rule should at once
suggest doubts as to the validity of the explanation.</p>

<p>It was <span class="nowrap">shown<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a></span> in 1865 by M. Victor Meunier that
some fluids were preserved after having been boiled in
a vessel of this kind, whilst others, submitted to the
same treatment, speedily became turbid from the presence
of <i>Bacteria</i> and other organisms<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></span> By these
experiments he ascertained that strong infusions did
frequently change, whilst weak ones might be preserved;
and that even a strong infusion might be
prevented from undergoing change if the period of
ebullition were sufficiently prolonged.</p>

<p>The fluids most frequently employed by M. Pasteur
were yeast-water, the same sweetened by sugar, urine,
infusion of beetroot, and infusion of pear.</p>

<p>Taking urine as a fair example of such a fluid, I
have found that the statements of M. Pasteur and of
Professor Lister are perfectly correct. This fluid may
generally remain for an indefinite period in such <span class="pagenum" title="63"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a></span><span class="nowrap">vessels<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a></span>
without becoming turbid, or undergoing any
apparent change. The same is generally found to
be the case with an infusion of turnip, and occasionally
an infusion of hay may be similarly prevented
from undergoing fermentation. On the other hand, if
the turnip-solution be neutralized by the addition of
a little ammonic carbonate, or liquor potassæ; or,
better still, if even half a grain of new cheese be added
to the infusion before it is boiled, then I have found
that the fluid speedily becomes turbid, owing to the
appearance of multitudes of <i>Bacteria</i>. In an infusion
to which a fragment of cheese had been added, I have
seen a pellicle form in three days, which, on microscopical
examination, proved to be composed of an
aggregation of <i>Bacteria</i>, <i>Vibriones</i>, and <i>Leptothrix</i> filaments.
A mixture of albuminous urine and turnip-infusion
has also rapidly become turbid in a vessel of
this kind owing to the appearance of multitudes of
<i>Bacteria</i>, and so has a mixture containing one-third
of healthy urine with two-thirds of infusion of turnip.</p>

<p>Other infusions have been boiled for ten minutes in a
vessel with a horizontal neck two feet long, into which,
during ebullition, a good plug of cotton-wool had been
carefully pushed down for a depth of twelve or fourteen
inches, and cautiously increased in quantity during<span class="pagenum" title="64"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a></span>
the continuance of the ebullition; whilst immediately
after the withdrawal of the heat, the plug was pressed
closer, and all the outer unoccupied portion of the
tube was rapidly filled up in the same manner.</p>

<p>Preserved in such a vessel, a specimen of urine
remained unchanged; a hay-infusion also underwent
no apparent alteration; whilst a very strong infusion
of turnip became turbid in five days, and ultimately
showed a large quantity of deposit<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a></span></p>

<p>Thus the rules laid down by Pasteur and others
are not universal, and therefore, as I have previously
pointed out, the explanation which he adduced of the
preservation of those particular fluids which remained
unchanged is at once rendered doubtful. More especially
is there room for doubt on this subject when, as
I have found, the result of the experiment can be,
within certain limits, predicated beforehand, according
to the nature of the fluid employed. If all organisms
proceed from pre-existing germs, and these can be
filtered from the air by a certain mechanical contrivance,
then, if it be alleged that it is on account of
such filtration that certain boiled fluids do not change,
all fluids placed under these conditions ought, on this
theory, to be similarly preserved. Exceptional cases
cannot be accounted for on this hypothesis. To<span class="pagenum" title="65"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a></span>
others, however, who say that organisms are capable
of arising <i>de novo</i>, and that fermentation can be
initiated without the agency of living things, the
above facts appear quite natural. The more complex
the nitrogenous or protein materials contained in a
solution, the more is it fitted to undergo fermentative
changes, which may be accompanied by the <i>de
novo</i> origination of living things. Therefore the above
results are just as compatible with the notions of
M. Liebig and his school, as they are antagonistic
to those of M. Pasteur. Certain fluids, it is found, do
not undergo change; whilst other fluids, of a more
complex description, will ferment under the influence
of similar conditions. Prolonged ebullition also, by
breaking up some of the more unstable compounds
of a solution (those which most easily initiate these
changes) will retard or prevent its fermentation.</p>

<p>The complete untenability of M. Pasteur’s explanations
are, however, best revealed by having recourse to
a series of comparative experiments, in which portions
of the same fluid are boiled for an equal length of time
in vessels of different kinds, and are then subsequently
submitted, in a water-bath, to the influence of the
same temperature.</p>

<p>I have made many experiments of this kind with
different solutions, some of which I will now record.
Owing to the different behaviour of the same fluids
under different conditions, we are enabled to draw
some most important conclusions; and owing to the<span class="pagenum" title="66"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a></span>
different behaviour of different fluids under these
respective conditions, our attention is strongly drawn
to other facts which ought considerably to influence
our judgment as to the relative merits of the two
doctrines concerning the cause of fermentation and
putrefaction.</p>

<h2>COMPARATIVE EXPERIMENTS.</h2>

<p>In the following experiments, each fluid (unless a
statement is made to the contrary) was <i>boiled continuously
for ten minutes</i>, after having been placed in
its flask. Then, with the neck either open, sealed,
or plugged, the bulb of the flask was immersed in a
water-bath maintained at a temperature of 80°–95°&nbsp;F.,
during both day and night<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a></span></p>

<h4><i>a. Fluid exposed to Air in a Flask with a short Open Neck.</i></h4>

<p class="expt"><b>No. I.&mdash;Urine</b> in twenty-four hours was still clear and free
from deposit. In forty-four hours the fluid was very
slightly turbid, and on microscopical examination <i>Bacteria</i>
and <i>Torulæ</i> were found, though not in very great
abundance. In sixty-eight hours the fluid was quite
turbid.</p>

<p class="expt"><b>No. II.&mdash;Hay Infusion</b> in twenty-four hours was still
clear. In forty-four hours the fluid was very turbid, and
a drop on examination showed multitudes of <i>Bacteria</i>
of different kinds, exhibiting languid movements. In
sixty-eight hours the turbidity had become much more<span class="pagenum ml1em" title="68"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a></span>
marked, and there was also a certain amount of sediment.</p>

<p class="expt"><b>No. III.&mdash;Turnip Infusion</b> in twenty-four hours showed
a very slight degree of turbidity. A drop examined
microscopically revealed a number of very minute, but
very active, <i>Bacteria</i>. In forty-four hours the turbidity
had become very well marked.</p>

<h4><i>b. Fluid in contact with Ordinary Air and its Particles;

<p class="expt"><b>No. IV.&mdash;Urine</b> remained quite bright and clear during the

<p class="expt"><b>No. V.&mdash;Hay Infusion</b> after forty-four hours showed a
well-marked turbidity. In sixty-eight hours there was
an increase in the amount of turbidity, and also some
sediment. During the next forty-eight hours turbidity
and sediment gradually increased, whilst the colour of
the fluid (originally that of port wine) became several
shades lighter. Except that it grew still lighter in
colour, and that the amount of sediment increased, it
underwent no further obvious change during the fifteen
days in which it remained in the bath<span class="nowrap">.<a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></span></p>

<p class="expt"><b>No. VI.&mdash;Turnip Infusion</b> underwent no change during

<p class="expt"><b>No. VIII.&mdash;Hay Infusion</b> remained bright and clear for
twelve days. On the thirteenth day a very slight
(almost inappreciable) sediment was seen, which scarcely
underwent any obvious increase during the next eight
days, though on the two following days (twenty-second
and twenty-third) the turbidity became most obvious:
much sediment was deposited, and the fluid assumed
a much lighter colour<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a></span> (On the twenty-second day
the temperature of the bath was raised to 100°&nbsp;F., for
two or three hours.)</p>

<p class="expt"><b>No. IX.&mdash;Turnip Infusion</b> remained for four days without
undergoing any apparent change. Its neck was then
accidentally broken at the fourth joint&mdash;a certain amount
of fluid still filling the third joint. In this condition
the flask was allowed to remain in the water-bath, and
the fluid continued quite unchanged in appearance for
five days. It was then <span class="nowrap">boiled<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a></span> for three minutes, and
the neck of the flask was <i>hermetically sealed</i> whilst the
fluid was boiling. The flask being re-immersed in
water-bath, the fluid continued quite clear for thirteen
days. Its neck was then carefully heated in the spirit-lamp
flame till, when red-hot, the rapid inbending
of the glass showed that the vacuum was still preserved.
This being ascertained, the flask was, after
a few minutes, replaced in the bath. The next day
the temperature of the bath was allowed to go up
to 100°&nbsp;F. for three or four hours, and in the evening
the fluid was observed to be very slightly turbid. In
two days more (<i>i.e.</i>, after sixteen days <i>in vacuo</i>) the<span class="pagenum ml1em" title="70"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a></span>
turbidity was well marked, and when the fluid was
examined microscopically it was found to contain an
abundance of very languid <i>Bacteria</i> and <i>Vibriones</i>. On
opening the flask there was an outrush of very fœtid
gas, and the reaction of the fluid was acid<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a></span></p>

<h4><i>d. Fluid in a Flask having a Neck two feet long, bent at right

<p class="expt"><b>No. XI.&mdash;Hay Infusion</b> showed a very slight amount of

somewhat during the next three days. The fluid afterwards
appeared to undergo no further change, though it
remained in the warm water-bath for fifteen days<span class="nowrap">.<a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a></span></p>

<p class="expt"><b>No. XII.&mdash;Turnip Infusion</b> in four days showed a well-marked

<h4><i>e. Fluid (in vacuo) in a Flask, the Neck of which was hermetically
Sealed by means of the Blowpipe Flame during
Ebullition.</i></h4>

<p class="expt"><b>No. XIII.&mdash;Urine</b> in forty-four hours showed a very
slight amount of sediment. During the next two days
the sediment very slightly increased, but was still small
in amount. At the expiration of fifteen days, no further
increase in the turbidity having taken place, the fluid
was examined. The vacuum was still partially preserved,
as evidenced by the rapid inbending of a portion
of the neck of the flask after it had been carefully made
red-hot. When opened, the odour of the fluid was
stale, but not fœtid, and its reaction was still faintly
acid. On microscopical examination <i>Bacteria</i> and
<i>Torulæ</i> were found in tolerable abundance.</p>

<p class="expt"><b>No. XIV.&mdash;Hay Infusion</b> in forty-four hours showed a
very slight amount of turbidity. In sixty-eight hours
the turbidity was most marked, and there was also a
small amount of sediment. In another twenty-four
hours it was noticed that the colour of the fluid had
become much lighter, whilst the turbidity and sediment
had increased. It subsequently continued in much the
same state, and the flask was opened on the sixteenth
day. The vacuum was found to be almost wholly
impaired, whilst the odour of the fluid was sour, and
not at all hay-like. On microscopical examination
<i>Bacteria</i>, <i>Vibriones</i>, <i>Leptothrix</i>, and <i>Torulæ</i>, were found
in abundance, and the former were very active.</p>

<p class="expt"><b>No. XV.&mdash;Turnip Infusion</b> after forty-eight hours showed
a well-marked turbidity. In seventy-two hours the turbidity
was more marked, and there was a slight amount
of sediment. The turbidity also increased during the<span class="pagenum ml1em" title="72"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a></span>
next twenty-four hours; though, after that, the infusion
seemed to undergo no further change. The flask
remained in the warm bath for fifteen days, when the
fluid was examined. Its odour was not fœtid, but was
somewhat like that of baked turnip. <i>Bacteria</i> and
<i>Vibriones</i> existed in abundance, though their movements
were extremely languid.</p>

outrush of very fœtid gas; the reaction of the fluid was
acid, and, when examined microscopically, it was found
to contain multitudes of very languid <i>Bacteria</i>.</p>

interlaced <i>Leptothrix</i> filaments. <i>Bacteria</i> also existed
abundantly in the fluid, though their movements were
very languid.</p>


<h4><i>c. Fluid in a Bent Neck Flask, having Eight acute Flexures.</i></h4>

<p class="expt"><b>No. XVIII.&mdash;Simple Turnip Infusion</b> after forty-eight

amongst the granular flakes of the deposit, <i>Torulæ</i> of
several varieties of size and shape. Many were spherical,
others ovoid, or having an elongated oat-like shape:
some were of the ordinary colour, and others were

and an acid re-action; and, on microscopical examination,
multitudes of <i>Bacteria</i> and <i>Vibriones</i> were seen.

<h4><i>Interpretation of the Experiments: Conclusions as to
the Cause of Fermentation, and as to the Occurrence
of</i> <b>Archebiosis</b>.</h4>

<p>These experiments seem to show quite conclusively
that M. Pasteur’s explanations are altogether inade<span class="pagenum" title="93"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a></span>quate
to account for the occasional preservation of
boiled fluids in bent-neck flasks. They show that the
preservation, far from being universal, is only occasional,
and that preservation or non-preservation of
different fluids is almost wholly dependent upon their
nature. They lend no countenance, moreover, to
his particular theory, that fermentation cannot be
initiated without the agency of living ferments,&mdash;they
are, on the contrary, wholly opposed to this restriction.</p>

<p>The plug of cotton-wool, or the narrow and bent tube
may, it is true, protect the boiled fluid from subsequent
contact with living “germs”; but that the fluids
do not undergo change on account of such deprivation
cannot be safely affirmed, when the same means
would also filter from the fluid some of the multitudinous
particles of organic matter (dead), which the
air undoubtedly contains, and which may act as
ferments. It must be remembered that the main
object of M. Pasteur’s investigation was to determine
whether fermentation took place under the agency of
mere dead nitrogenous matter, as Liebig and others
affirm; or whether it is only initiated by living
organisms, as he himself supposes. Obviously, therefore,
the same filtration which purified the air from
any living organisms would filter from it its nitrogenous
particles, which are the other possible
ferments: so that no conclusion could be drawn
from such experiments, more favourable to the one
than to the other of these hypotheses. All that<span class="pagenum" title="94"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a></span>
could have been safely affirmed was, that by boiling
the fluid, and then protecting it from subsequent contact
with everything that could act as a ferment,
fermentation would not take place.</p>

<p>Even this however,&mdash;as the preceding experiments
fully show&mdash;cannot be truly affirmed to be a general
rule. Some infusions do undergo change, notwithstanding
this treatment and deprivation, whilst others
do not: that is to say, some still preserve a first
degree of fermentability even after boiling, whilst
others are reduced by this process to the second
degree of fermentability. These latter are unable to
initiate changes by virtue of their own inherent instability;
molecular re-arrangements require to be set
on foot in them by contact with some more unstable
substance, which is itself undergoing change.</p>

<p>That such is the correct explanation of the reason
why <i>some</i> fluids do not ferment in bent-neck flasks,
seems obvious from the discordant results obtained
in many other experiments, after the free admission of
uncalcined air to the fluids which had been boiled.
The fluids were deprived of their virtues in some cases
by the heat to which they had been subjected, so that
whether they underwent change or not, may have
depended upon the accidental presence or absence,
in the air which was subsequently admitted to the
fluid, of some unheated organic fragments, capable
of initiating fermentative changes. If germs were
as omnipresent as they have been represented to<span class="pagenum" title="95"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a></span>
be, such fluids ought always to have undergone fermentation.</p>

<p>Whilst I have found that any given fluid, whose
strength is about equal on different occasions, acts in
a definite manner when the flask is hermetically
sealed after expulsion of all its air and during the
continuance of ebullition; and, whilst a like definite
result can generally be obtained, when calcined air
is admitted to the boiled fluid before the vessel is
hermetically sealed; it is found, on the other hand,
that the result is in no way predicable when uncalcined
air is admitted. Sometimes fermentation takes
place, and sometimes in other flasks&mdash;sealed at the
same time, and subsequently placed under the same
conditions&mdash;no change whatever occurs. My own
experience in this respect accords perfectly with that
of M. Pasteur<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a></span> He, however, at once came to the
conclusion that the only inference from such facts
was that “germs” are not so universally distributed
as they had been supposed to be by Bonnet and
Spallanzani<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a></span> The unprejudiced inquirer, however,
will perceive that M. Pasteur was entitled to come to
no such conclusion concerning germs which was not
equally applicable to minute fragments or débris of
organic matter floating in the air. And, similarly,
the evidence which he adduces with regard to the
diminution in the number of the fertile flasks when
they were filled with some of the still air of the caves<span class="pagenum" title="96"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a></span>
of the observatory, or else with some from the peaks
of the Jura<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a></span> far away from the haunts of men, had
no bearing upon the distribution of germs which was
not equally applicable to that of dead organic
particles. Such evidence, therefore, was valueless for
settling between the rival doctrines of fermentation&mdash;it
could not possibly help us to decide whether living or
dead ferments were necessary. Dead organic particles
would sink in still air in the same manner as living
organisms<span class="nowrap">;<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a></span> and similarly, dead organic particles,
have been shown to be less and less numerous in the
atmosphere in proportion to the elevation obtained<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a></span>
In these latter experiments M. Pasteur made use of
yeast-water (alone or sweetened), and of urine&mdash;all
three of them fluids, which, after having been boiled,
are apt to possess only the second degree of fermentability.
Shortly afterwards, M. Pouchet, in concert
with MM. Joly and Musset<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a></span> repeated these experiments,
with the sole difference that they employed
strong infusions of hay&mdash;which experiment has shown
almost invariably to possess the first degree of fermentability.
And seeing that all their flasks, after a time,
yielded organisms from whatever mountain elevation<span class="pagenum" title="97"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a></span>
the air had been taken&mdash;the combined evidence tends
strongly against the view of M. Pasteur. Since
the germs in the fluids and in the flasks, in each set
of experiments, had been previously destroyed by
ebullition, and since in each set, also, air of the same
character had been admitted to the boiled fluids, the
different results seemed to show that fermentation or
non-fermentation, in such cases, depends wholly upon
the quality of the fluids employed.</p>

<p>Other evidence which is so much vaunted by M.&nbsp;Pasteur
and his supporters, as to the possibility
of inducing fertility in previously sterile flasks, by
the addition of a portion of asbestos containing the
solid particles filtered from the atmosphere<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a></span> is also
equally valueless for confirming the proposition that
fermentation is only capable of being initiated by
living ferments. The same asbestos which <i>may</i>
contain living spores or organisms (“germs”), does
undoubtedly contain many decomposable particles
and fragments of organic matter<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a></span> The previously
barren solution may therefore be rendered fertile by the<span class="pagenum" title="98"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a></span>
mere addition of those portions of unstable organic
matter, whose molecular mobility has not been impaired
by the agency of heat, and which are therefore capable
of initiating fermentations. This view is strengthened,
as M. Pouchet has pointed out, by the fact that in
these cases, instead of meeting some of the <i>various</i>
kinds of organisms which are supposed to have representatives
in the air, and whose spores or ova may be
supposed to have been sown, it is often merely <i>Bacteria</i>
which are encountered,&mdash;differing in no respect
from those that may present themselves in a somewhat
similar infusion, which has undergone change
in a closed flask without any such hypothetical sowing
of living spores or germs. It is more especially important
to bear in mind this consideration, when portions
of organic matter can always be easily demonstrated
amongst such atmospheric dust; whilst living
<i>Bacteria</i>, or other organisms, such as are first produced
as a result of the supposed sowing of spores, either
cannot be demonstrated, or would seem, from other
evidence, to be at least very sparingly distributed<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a></span></p>

<p>The fact revealed by M. Pasteur, that <i>some</i> fluids
remain unchanged for an indefinite period, after having
been boiled in flasks, with long and bent necks, is
easily explicable in accordance with the physical
theory of fermentation, and now that it has been
thoroughly proved that <i>other</i> fluids&mdash;submitted to pre<span class="pagenum" title="99"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a></span>cisely
similar conditions&mdash;do nevertheless undergo
fermentation, this fresh fact is just as completely
adverse to the explanations and views of M. Pasteur,
as it is thoroughly harmonious with the doctrines of
Baron Liebig. The fluids which are capable of being
preserved&mdash;generally not presenting a high degree of
fermentability&mdash;do not undergo change, <i>at ordinary
atmospheric pressure</i>, after having been boiled, unless
they are brought into contact either with some pre-existing
living things or with some unaltered organic
particles from the atmosphere. Neither of these, however,
can gain access to the fluid, in such a vessel;
because all the air which enters, after the first inrush
into the still almost boiling fluid, has to pass, more or
less slowly, through the numerous flexures of the narrow
neck of the flask and the two or three strata of
fluid which always remain therein.</p>

<p>Some of the fluids which do not undergo change in
these bent-neck vessels are, however, by no means
notable for possessing a low degree of fermentability.
This is the case, for instance, with infusions of turnip,
which, under other conditions, have been found to be
most prone to undergo fermentation. And, I have
found in several cases in which such an infusion
had been exposed in a bent-neck vessel, and had
remained unchanged for twelve or fourteen days (even
though subjected to a temperature of 85°–95°&nbsp;F.), that
if the neck of the flask were then broken shortly above
the bulb, the solution would still continue without<span class="pagenum" title="100"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a></span>
alteration for a week, ten days, a fortnight, or even
more&mdash;although freely exposed to the air, and therefore
to the access of any living germs which might be
floating about in the atmosphere<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a></span></p>

<p>The views hitherto expressed with reference to the
causes of fermentation and putrefaction, and to the
interpretations which M. Pasteur’s experiments are
capable of receiving, seem to derive all the additional
support that can be needed, from the results of my
own experiments with boiled fluids, in sealed flasks,
from which all air had been expelled.</p>

<p>Some of the same fluid being taken and divided
into three parts, each portion is placed in a separate
flask, in which it is boiled for a period of ten minutes.
One of the flasks (A) is provided with a long and bent
neck, so that the air which re-enters is deprived of
its germs and organic particles; another (B) has only<span class="pagenum" title="101"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a></span>
a short neck, and to this, the access of germs and
organic particles is freely permitted till the fluid has
become cool, and then the neck of the flask is
hermetically sealed; whilst the last (C) is sealed
during ebullition, after all air has been expelled.
Now, if Pasteur’s theory of fermentation, and the
prevalent notions concerning the universal distribution
of “germs” throughout the atmosphere were true, it
might be expected that the fluid in B would always
rapidly change; that that in A would always remain
pure; and that the fluid in C would, similarly, undergo
no alteration. The facts, however, are quite the
reverse: if a strong turnip infusion be employed, the
fluid in A will almost always remain unchanged; that
in B will sometimes rapidly change, and at other times
will remain quite pure; whilst that in C will almost
invariably become turbid in from two to six days.
But, even if it were not the case that some fluids,
different from those used by M. Pasteur, will almost
invariably undergo change in bent-neck vessels, M.&nbsp;Pasteur’s
explanation of the cause of the preservation
would have been altogether upset by the fact that
<i>some of the very fluids which remain pure in the bent-neck
apparatus will become fœtid if shut up in vacuo</i>. It
is, therefore, of course useless to talk of a particular
boiled fluid having been saved from putrefaction on
the ground that the living atmospheric germs (whose
presence is supposed to be necessary for the initiation
of such a process) have been altogether filtered from<span class="pagenum" title="102"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a></span>
the re-entering air, when some of the same fluid will
putrefy, if placed under different conditions by which
it is freed both from the influence of the atmosphere
and from its germs&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, when, instead of filtering the
re-entering air, no air is permitted to enter. Germs
and atmospheric particles being equally got rid of in
both sets of cases, the great difference between them
is that the weight of the atmosphere is also got rid of
in my experiments&mdash;the fluids being contained <i>in
vacuo</i>. Now it has been ascertained by Mr. Sorby, that
pressure undoubtedly influences “chemical changes
taking place slowly, and therefore, probably due to
weak or nearly counterbalanced affinities;” and he
also states, in the Bakerian Lecture for 1863<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a></span> that
“a considerable number of facts have been described,
showing that pressure will more or less influence such
chemical actions as are accompanied by an evolution
of gas, so that it may cause a compound to be permanent,
which otherwise would be decomposed.” If
increase of pressure retards, a diminution of pressure
will facilitate such chemical changes, so that one can
only explain the results which I have obtained, on the
ground that many boiled fluids, which will not undergo
change when protected from the influence of atmospheric
particles (living or not living) at the same time that
they are subjected to ordinary or increased pressure,<span class="pagenum" title="103"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a></span>
will, on the contrary, pass through such changes when
pressure is removed, and the fluids are preserved
<i>in vacuo</i>. It is not pretended that this is a rule applicable
to <i>all</i> organic fluids&mdash;far from it. Diminution
of pressure does seem, however, to be a very potential
cause of change in some fluids. The extent to which
changes of a fermentative character can progress in
the absence of atmospheric oxygen, is also evidently
subject to much variation, in accordance with the
nature of the dissolved fermentable substances.</p>

<p>These facts are not so new and exceptional, however,
as they may at first sight appear. It has been long
known that a boiled fluid extremely prone to change,
will not yield infusoria if the vessel in which it is
contained is filled with the fluid. Burdach <span class="nowrap">says<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a></span>:&mdash;“Gruithuisen
a reconnu que des infusions, même très
fécondes d’ailleurs, celles du foin par exemple, ne
donnaient point d’infusoires dans des flacons de
verre dont le bouchon était assez enfoncé pour toucher
à la surface de l’eau.” On the other hand, no experiments
with which I am acquainted, in which heated
fluids and calcined air have been shut up in closed
flasks, have yielded so many positive results as those
of Professor Wyman of Cambridge, U.S.,&mdash;and his
were performed under precisely the reverse conditions.
Large flasks were used, and only <span class="nowrap"> <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">15</span></span></span>&#8239;&ndash;&#8239;<span class="nowrap"> <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">20</span></span></span> of their bulk<span class="pagenum" title="104"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a></span>
was filled by the experimental fluids<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a></span> Gruithuisen’s
results were explained by Burdach on the ground that
a certain amount of air was necessary, and it was also
with the view of subjecting his fluids to as large an
amount of air (calcined) as possible, that Professor
Wyman employed small quantities of fluids in large
flasks. These views were dictated by the chemical
doctrines of Gay-Lussac and others, to the effect that
the oxygen of the air is the initiator or <i>primum
movens</i> of fermentative changes<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a></span></p>

<p>Now, without doubting in the least that in some
instances this may be the case, it seems to me quite
obvious, from my own experiments, that a different
interpretation may be given of Gruithuisen’s results&mdash;which
I have myself verified,&mdash;and of the fact that
meats and vegetables will often remain unchanged for
years after having been heated in closed tins from
which all air has been expelled<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a></span></p>

<p>If we ponder only upon the fact that certain fluids,
in contact with a very small quantity of air, in an
hermetically-closed vessel, will not undergo change;
though these same fluids will change when exposed<span class="pagenum" title="105"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a></span>
to a much larger quantity of calcined air, there may
be strong reason for coming to an opinion similar to
that of Gay-Lussac. When, however, it is also
ascertained that provisions which have been subjected
to the long-continued influence of heat, do not undergo
change in closed vessels, if all air has been expelled
from the <i>very small space above the level of the provisions</i>;
though many organic infusions will putrefy
if they occupy only one half, or less, of a hermetically
closed vessel from which all air has been similarly expelled
by ebullition of its fluid contents, it is impossible
that the same explanation can hold good. And
at the same time another interpretation is suggested
for the first set of facts.</p>

<p>The last-mentioned experiments <span class="nowrap">prove<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a></span> that fermentation
can take place <i>in vacuo</i>, when the
conditions are more favourable than those which
present themselves within the almost full tins containing
provisions. The change in these latter cases
cannot (in the great majority of instances) proceed
<span class="nowrap">far<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a></span>, because there is no adequate space into which<span class="pagenum" title="106"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a></span>
residual gases may be emitted. When this emission
(which is almost always one of the accompaniments
of a fermentative change) has taken place to a slight
extent, the meats are in the very best condition for
preservation. There is an utter absence of light, an
absence of free oxygen, and also an absence of that
diminished pressure which my experiments seem to
show is favourable to the promotion of many kinds of
fermentative change. So that if fermentation does
not take place in a closed flask which is <i>full</i> of a
boiled infusion of hay<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a></span> it may be owing to the fact
that there is no space for the residual gases, and that
undue pressure retards many fermentative changes.
This is also perfectly compatible with the other fact
that the same kind of fluid will undergo change when
a small quantity of it is contained in a comparatively
large flask&mdash;owing to there being, in such a case,
plenty of room for residual gases to be effused, before
that undue amount of pressure is brought about, in
the presence of which such a fluid will no longer
ferment or putrefy. Fluids, therefore, whose putre<span class="pagenum" title="107"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a></span>faction
is hindered by increased pressure and favoured
by diminution of pressure, may be placed under conditions
which are successively more favourable than
the last, by putting a gradually smaller and smaller
quantity of fluid into a flask, to which calcined air is
admitted, and, better still&mdash;if the stimulus of oxygen
is not absolutely needed in order to incite fermentation
in the fluid employed&mdash;by only half filling the
flask, and procuring a more and more perfect vacuum.</p>

<p>In accordance with the doctrines of Baron Liebig,
therefore, my experiments, as well as those of many
other investigators, tend to show that fermentative and
putrefactive changes are merely processes of chemical
re-arrangement, which frequently take place&mdash;as it
were “spontaneously”&mdash;owing to the inherent instability
of certain nitrogenous compounds in the presence
of free oxygen. My experiments have, however, also
revealed the additional fact that, under the combined
influence of heat and diminished pressure, some fluids
will undergo fermentation even in closed vessels, from
which all air has been expelled. They lend no support
to the idea that the air is so thickly laden with
<i>living germs</i> as some would have us suppose; and in
view of the mass of positive information now in our
possession concerning the degree of heat which suffices
to kill the lowest organisms, they also, as I think,
entitle us to come to the conclusion that such organisms
are (as the microscopical evidence might lead us<span class="pagenum" title="108"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a></span>
to believe) really capable of being evolved <i>de novo</i>.
These lowest organisms are, in fact, to be regarded
as occasional concomitant products, rather than as
invariable or necessary causes of all fermentative
changes.</p>

<p>It would thus appear that specks of living matter
may be born in suitable fluids, just as specks of crystalline
matter may arise in other fluids. Both processes are
really alike inexplicable&mdash;both products are similarly
the results of the operation of inscrutable natural laws,
and what seem to be inherent molecular affinities.
The properties of living matter, just as much as the
properties of crystalline matter, are dependent upon
the number, kind, and mode of collocation of the
atoms and molecules entering into its composition.
There is no more reason for a belief in the existence
of a special “vital force,” than there is for a similar
belief in the existence of a special “crystalline force.”
The ultimate elements of living matter are in all probability
highly complex, whilst those of crystalline
matter are comparatively simple. Living matter
develops into Organisms of different kinds, whilst
crystalline matter grows into Crystals of diverse
shapes. The greater modifiability of living matter,
and the reproductive property by which it is essentially
distinguished from crystalline matter, seem both
alike referable to the great molecular complexity and
mobility of the former. Crystals are statical, whilst<span class="pagenum" title="109"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a></span>
organisms are dynamical aggregates, though the evolution
of both, marked by their peculiar characteristics,
may be regarded as visible expressions testifying to
the existence of one all-pervading Power</p>

some degree of civilization; while Central Africa is peopled by a race of

<p><i>When young children have acquired the outlines of history from abridgments
and catechisms, and it becomes desirable to give a more enlarged
view of the subject, in order to render it really useful and interesting, a
difficulty often arises as to the choice of books. Two courses are open, either
to take a general and consequently dry history of facts, such as Russell’s
Modern Europe, or to choose some work treating of a particular period or
subject, such as the works of Macaulay and Froude. The former course
usually renders history uninteresting; the latter is unsatisfactory, because
it is not sufficiently comprehensive. To remedy this difficulty, selections,
continuous and chronological, have in the present volume been taken from
the larger works of Freeman, Milman, Palgrave, and others, which may
serve as distinct landmarks of historical reading. “We know of scarcely
anything,” says the Guardian, of this volume, “which is so likely to raise
to a higher level the average standard of English education.</i>”</p>

<p><i>This work is an attempt to do for Japan what Sir J. Davis, Dr. Legge,

more enlightened ideas and of a liberal system of policy, the old Japanese
civilization is fast disappearing, and will, in a few years, be completely
extinct. It was important, therefore, to preserve as far as possible trustworthy
records of a state of society which although venerable from its antiquity,
has for Europeans the dawn of novelty; hence the series of narratives
and legends translated by Mr. Mitford, and in which the Japanese
are very judiciously left to tell their own tale. The two volumes comprise
not only stories and episodes illustrative of Asiatic superstitions, but also
three sermons. The preface, appendices, and notes explain a number of
local peculiarities; the thirty-one woodcuts are the genuine work of a native
artist, who, unconsciously of course, has adopted the process first introduced

with the “siècle de Louis Quatorze;” any previous literature being for
the most part unknown or ignored. Few know anything of the enormous
literary activity that began in the thirteenth century, was carried on by
Rulebeuf, Marie de France, Gaston de Foix, Thibault de Champagne,
and Lorris; was fostered by Charles of Orleans, by Margaret of Valois,
by Francis the First; that gave a crowd of versifiers to France, enriched,
strengthened, developed, and fixed the French language, and prepared the
way for Corneille and for Racine. The present work aims to afford
information and direction touching the early efforts of France in poetical

are admirable for their scholarly editing, their typographical
excellence, their compendious form, and their cheapness.”</b></p>

<p>Under the title GLOBE EDITIONS, the Publishers are
issuing a uniform Series of Standard English Authors,
carefully edited, clearly and elegantly printed on toned
paper, strongly bound, and at a small cost. The names of
the Editors whom they have been fortunate enough to
secure constitute an indisputable guarantee as to the
character of the Series. The greatest care has been taken
to ensure accuracy of text; adequate notes, elucidating
historical, literary, and philological points, have been supplied;
and, to the older Authors, glossaries are appended.
The series is especially adapted to Students of our national
Literature; while the small price places good editions of
certain books, hitherto popularly inaccessible, within the
reach of all. The <i>Saturday Review</i> says: “The Globe
Editions of our English Poets are admirable for their
scholarly editing, their typographical excellence, their compendious
form, and their cheapness.”</p>

Notwithstanding what Professor Huxley has said, I believe
it to be almost certain that in many cases <i>Bacteria</i> exist in a
solution in which there are neither <i>Torulæ</i> nor developed fungi.
And, on the other hand, I have seen fungi growing in a simple
(boiled) solution of tartrate of ammonia, for weeks together,
without the appearance of <i>Bacteria</i> or the occurrence of any
turbidity of the solution; and on two or three occasions I have
seen <i>Torulæ</i> swarming in an infusion without the presence of
<i>Bacteria</i>.</p></div>

However novel such a mode of origin of independent <i>Bacteria</i>
and <i>Vibriones</i> may appear to some, it will seem much less
strange and unlikely to others who have seen, as I have done, an
<i>Amœba</i>, or an <i>Actinophrys</i>-like body, originate from the progressive
molecular modifications taking place in a mass of
chlorophyll and protoplasm within the filament of an alga.
Many independent observers have watched all the stages of this
process, and some have even seen Ciliated Infusoria originate
by such a metamorphic change.</p></div>

From this view the transition is also easy, though none the
less illegitimate, to the doctrine that <i>all</i> fermentations are caused
by organisms; just as it has been easy to start, and find converts
for, the doctrine expressed by the phrase “<i>omne vivum ex vivo</i>.”
The distinction between <i>all</i> and <i>some</i> is only too often overlooked.</p></div>

Those who hold this opinion do not of course deny that
living ferments can initiate fermentations. Every-day experience
convinces them of the truth of this. They merely affirm
that the intervention of vital action is not essential: they look
upon fermentation as a purely chemical process, and believe that
even in those cases where fermentation is initiated by living
organisms (such as beer-yeast), these&mdash;although living&mdash;act chemically
upon the matter which undergoes fermentation.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_12" href="#FNanchor_12" class="label">12</a>
They may not believe this, because they may be unaware of
the fact of the invariable association of some organisms with
some kinds of fermentations, and may consequently have never
concerned themselves with the evidence bearing upon this part
of the question. (See Gerhardt, <i>loc. cit.</i>)</p></div>

detected floating about in the atmosphere.</p></div>

M. Pasteur’s use of this term, in which he is followed by
others holding similar opinions, is much to be deprecated.
Having said that he had found certain corpuscles which resembled
spores of fungi, or ova of infusoria, he subsequently speaks
of them as “germs,” and also applies the same name to the reproductive
particles of <i>Bacteria</i>, which he merely <i>assumes</i> to be
present in the atmosphere. Thus, having only proved that
corpuscles resembling spores of some fungi, are to be found in
the atmosphere, he subsequently speaks of the presence of a
multitude of atmospheric germs as an established fact, without
at all prominently pointing out that, so far as the most important
of these are concerned&mdash;germs of <i>Bacteria</i>&mdash;their existence had
only been inferred, and not proved.</p></div>

As expressed, the proposition may be an approximation to
the truth. M. Pasteur, however, really endeavours to lead his
readers to believe that the “solid particles” which are efficacious,
are, in all cases, living “germs.”</p></div>

It was necessary to boil the solution first, in order to destroy
any living things or dead ferments which it might contain. It
must contain one or the other, because an unboiled solution of

There is, however, another point of extreme interest in connection
with these experiments, bearing upon the supposed universal
distribution of “germs” of <i>Bacteria</i> and other organisms,
which I will now mention. One of the flasks, which had been
exposed to 140°&nbsp;F., and which had been hermetically sealed at this
temperature, had its neck cracked (accidentally) about half an
hour afterwards. Thinking it would be as well, not­with­standing
this, to keep it and observe the result, its bulb was immersed in
the same water-bath with the other flasks which had been prepared
at the same time. Whilst the fluid in one of these which
had been exposed to a heat of 131°&nbsp;F., became turbid in the course
of a few days, this, which had been exposed to a heat of 140°&nbsp;F.
and whose neck was also extensively cracked, remained quite clear
for seven days, although to such an extent exposed to the access
of germs. Its eminent suitability for nourishing the germs of
such organisms was also shown, because, on the seventh day,
the fluid being still clear, the blade of a penknife was dipped into
it, after having been previously immersed in a solution containing
living <i>Bacteria</i> and <i>Torulæ</i>, and in thirty-six hours after this
inoculation, the fluid had become turbid, owing to the presence of
myriads of these organisms. So that even where obvious cracks
occur, and the vacuum is altogether impaired by the consequent
inrush of air, such air does not necessarily carry with it germs of
<i>Bacteria</i>&mdash;which have been supposed to be universally diffused,
and capable of passing through cracks so minute as to be invisible.
These results, important as they are, have not at all
surprised me, because one may frequently find a previously boiled
solution of the kind under consideration, remaining free from
turbidity for two weeks or more, although the neck of the flask
has been merely covered by a loose paper-cap (see p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_30">30</a>).</p></div>

The <i>Bacteria</i> and <i>Vibriones</i> with which Professor Wyman
experimented were derived from different sources; and so far as
I also have been able to ascertain, the <i>Bacteria</i> of different fluids
are similarly affected by exposure to similar degrees of heat.
Thus, if on the same slip, though under different covering glasses,
specimens of a hay infusion, turbid with <i>Bacteria</i>, are mounted,
(<i>a</i>) without being heated, (<i>b</i>) after the fluid has been raised to
122°&nbsp;F. for ten minutes, and (<i>c</i>) after the fluid has been heated to
140°&nbsp;F. for ten minutes, it will be found that, in the course of a
few days, the <i>Bacteria</i> under <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> have notably increased in
quantity, whilst those under <i>c</i> do not become more numerous,
however long the slide is kept. Facts of the same kind are observable
if a turnip infusion, containing living <i>Bacteria</i>, is experimented
with; and the phenomena are in no way different if a
solution of ammonic tartrate and sodic phosphate (containing
<i>Bacteria</i>) be employed instead of one of these vegetable infusions.
The multiplication of the <i>Bacteria</i> beneath the covering-glass,
when it occurs, is soon rendered obvious, even to the naked eye,
by the increasing cloudiness of the film.</p></div>

of ox-gall. Of three decoctions of beef with

This experiment is very interesting in two or three respects.
A neck of half the usual length&mdash;with only four bendings&mdash;sufficed
to preserve the fluid for several days; and when this fluid (which
had been in the bent-neck apparatus for nine days) was sealed
up in the same flask during ebullition, it remained <i>in vacuo</i> for
thirteen days without undergoing any apparent change, and then
only became turbid under the influence of a higher temperature.
Yet some of the same fluid, in a flask which was hermetically
sealed during the first ebullition (No. XV.) behaved as such an
infusion usually does, and became quite turbid in forty-eight
hours.</p></div>

This again is a most instructive experiment when compared
with Nos. XVI. and XX., in which portions of the same infusion
were employed. The results in No. IX. would lead us to believe
that a vegetable infusion which does not ferment, does, nevertheless,
undergo some changes in molecular composition, and
this notion seems to derive confirmation from the present experiment.
Some of the same solution which has been kept for
a time (twelve days) from contact with atmospheric particles,
subsequently, even when fully exposed to the air, undergoes no
apparent change for six days, and then, instead of becoming
filled with <i>Bacteria</i>, swarms only with <i>Torulæ</i>. Yet the infusion
in this condition was perfectly capable of nourishing <i>Bacteria</i>,
as I subsequently proved by inoculating it. Why then was it
not inoculated by the living <i>Bacteria</i>, with which the air is
thought by some to be teeming?</p></div>

This experiment should be compared with Nos. XVIII. and
XXXIII. It seems to show that if some fermentable fluids can
be kept for a time under conditions in which they will not ferment,
the constitution of the fluid, instead of remaining the same,
undergoes a slow alteration by which it is rendered absolutely
less fermentable, even when exposed to the most favouring
influences.</p></div>

After this experiment had been completed, a fresh-filtered
infusion of turnip was placed in the same flask (having the neck
open just beyond its second bending), and after having been
boiled for a few minutes it was immersed in the same water-bath.
This fluid became turbid in thirty-six hours, and was then found
to contain multitudes of <i>Bacteria</i>; and the characteristic odour
of the turnip infusion was still appreciable.</p></div>

The results of this experiment are most interesting, especially
if compared with what takes place when some of the same
fluid is neutralized by ammonic carbonate (No. XXXIV.),
with what occurs when a similar fluid (as in No. XXX.) is contained
in a flask sealed during the continuance of ebullition, or also
with what occurred in Nos. XIII. and XXXII. In the present
case the second boiling seems to have destroyed what small
amount of fermentability there was still remaining in the solution;
but in No. IX. fermentation did take place after the second
boiling&mdash;though this occurred only under the influence of diminished
pressure and a higher temperature.</p></div>

The results of this experiment, and of No. LXIII. are decidedly
opposed to the reality of the germ-killing powers with
which carbolic acid has been endowed by Professor Lister and
others. I, however, had previously found that specimens of
<i>Torulæ</i> and <i>Bacteria</i>, obtained from freshly opened flasks, and
then mounted as microscopical specimens in a mixture of
glycerine and carbolic acid (in the proportion of 15:1), not
unfrequently grew and multiplied under such conditions. MM.&nbsp;Béchamp
and Estor, also found that <i>Bacteria</i> multiplied in carbolized
fluids, and similar facts have been testified to by some
Italian observers. But, organic fluids differ much from one
another, so that the influence of carbolic acid may well be different
upon different fluids. And, accordingly, we find that whilst its
addition to, and subsequent boiling with, a hay infusion increases
the fermentability of this, precisely the opposite effects are produced
when the hay is replaced by a turnip infusion (see
No. XLV.). Without wishing to undervalue in the least the system
of treatment introduced, and so admirably carried out by Professor
Lister, I am strongly of opinion that he explains his results
by theories which are almost wholly incorrect.</p></div>

All the simple ammoniacal solutions were in the proportion
of ten grains of the salt to the fluid ounce of distilled water; and
to those which also contained sodic phosphate, three grains of

On comparing the corresponding experiments of series
XLVIII.&ndash;LI. with those of series LIII.&ndash;LVI. less difference
is found than might have been expected by many. The comparison
of the numbers of each series with one another, also
reveals the interesting fact, that the mere presence of N, C, O,
and H, is not all that is required, even for the growth and nutrition
of the lower living things. These elements seem to lapse into
the new combinations constituting living matter of various kinds,
more easily from certain pre-existing states of combination than
from others. Solutions of ammonic tartrate are much more
favourable starting points for the new combinations than solutions
of ammonic acetate. The comparison of experiment No.
LI. with No. LII. is extremely interesting in reference to the
dogma that phosphorus is a necessary ingredient in living matter.
Solutions of the ammonic tartrate in distilled water have been
twice analyzed for me by a skilled chemist, without revealing the
least trace either of phosphorus or sulphur. This result is very
remarkable when compared with the amount of living matter
which may so soon appear in such a solution: the number
of the organisms and the rapidity of their evolution, being
almost equal to that which occurs in a similar solution to which
a phosphate has been added. However much, therefore, phosphorus
may aid the development of organisms in many fluids,
there is still an important difference between <i>many</i> and <i>all</i>,
which if more frequently borne in mind, would render universal
propositions more scarce (see ‘Journal of Chemical Society,’
March, 1871, pp.&nbsp;72–74). The truth of the dictum “<i>Ohne Phosphor
gar kein Leben</i>,” is, I venture to think, far from being
proved. If on insufficient evidence (referring only to particular
fluids) such a dictum is arrived at; and if then, the presence of
organisms in any fluid is to be taken as evidence of the existence
of phosphorus (even though this cannot be otherwise substantiated),
the case of phosphorus in relation to Life comes to be
similar to the case of the much abused germs.

The fluids were boiled at the low temperature, with the aid
of an air-pump, merely in order to be able to procure a more

to show whether the simple (uninoculated) solutions would become

were incapable of being inoculated, or that they were unsuitable
for the development of the lower forms of life, as was shown by
their subsequent fate, and by the fact that they can always
speedily be made to become turbid if they are really inoculated
with living <i>Bacteria</i>. Almost similar facts in opposition to the
prevalent Panspermic views have been noted by Professor Cantoni
(Rend. del R. Istit. Lombardo, Novembre, 1869). He found
(as I have also frequently found) that when fluids had been subjected
to the influence of high temperatures, and had subsequently
remained sterile in closed flasks, they might be freely
exposed to the air for one or two weeks, or more, without becoming
turbid&mdash;although at any time a general turbidity could
be speedily induced, by introducing a few living <i>Bacteria</i> into
the fluid.</p></div>

would not take place <i>in vacuo</i>, or without the presence of
free oxygen, which was and still is, believed by many, to be the
immediate determining cause of fermentation.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_89" href="#FNanchor_89" class="label">89</a>
This proof is more severe in certain other experiments (not
yet published) in which I had the benefit of Professor Frankland’s
assistance. The vacuum in these cases was perhaps more perfect,
having been procured by means of a Sprengel’s pump and
a simultaneous ebullition of the fluid, during which the flasks
were hermetically sealed. The closed flasks were subsequently
exposed to a temperature of 293°&nbsp;F. for a short time.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_90" href="#FNanchor_90" class="label">90</a>
An examination of tins of “perfectly good” meats has convinced
me that a very small number of <i>Bacteria</i> and <i>Leptothrix</i>
filaments are occasionally to be met with.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_91" href="#FNanchor_91" class="label">91</a>
It has, however, been ascertained by M. Pouchet, that beer-yeast,
even after prolonged ebullition, will undergo change in a
flask which is full and hermetically sealed; and the manufacturers
of preserved meats also find that occasionally, in some of
their best prepared tins, the meats become putrid, and that the
putridity is accompanied by the presence of organisms. Some
fermentations are doubtless attended by a less copious emission
of waste gases than that which characterizes other fermentations;
and some fermentations will progress in spite of a moderate
amount of pressure.</p></div></div>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
